# PURL

PURL service is a URL resolver that translates a reference to a digital object (in the form of a `druid`), into a full content representation of that object as available in public access environment

## Requirements

1. Ruby (3.2 or greater)
2. [bundler](http://bundler.io/) gem

## Installation

Clone the repository

    $ git clone git@github.com:sul-dlss/purl.git

Move into the app and install dependencies

    $ cd purl
    $ bundle install
    $ yarn

Start the development server

    $ bin/dev

## Configuring

Configuration is handled through the [RailsConfig](/railsconfig/config) settings.yml files.

#### Local Configuration

The defaults in `config/settings.yml` should work on a locally run installation.

## Testing

The test suite (with RuboCop style enforcement) will be run with the default rake task (also run on travis)

    $ rake

The specs can be run without RuboCop style enforcement

    $ rake spec

The RuboCop style enforcement can be run without running the tests

    $ rake rubocop

## Deploying

Deployment is handled automatically via Jenkins when a release is published to GitHub.
