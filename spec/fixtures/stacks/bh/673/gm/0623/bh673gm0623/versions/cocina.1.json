Along with this reflection, Smith provides a brief history of this period of organizing and highlights the ways in which this organizing work represented the culmination of her human rights education at Stanford. Throughout this paper, Smith delineates how successful human rights work operates by continually zooming in and out of power structures and people’s personal experiences. Smith hopes this reflection and personal narrative can be a source of reference and information for future human rights student activists at Stanford.\r\n\r\nStudent project deposited by department for archival purposes.
