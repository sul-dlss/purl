    <text> I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the
      learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days
      --nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great
      knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my
      proceedings in my days; yea, I make a record in the language of my father, which consists of
      the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians. And I know that the record which I
      make, to be true; and I make it with mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.
      For it came to pass in the commencement of the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, king of
      Judah, (my father Lehi having dwelt at Jerusalem in all his days;) and in that same year there
      came many prophets, prophesying unto the people, that they must repent, or the great city
      Jerusalem must be destroyed. Wherefore it came to pass, that my father Lehi, as he went forth,
      prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his people. And it came to
      pass, as he prayed unto the Lord, there came a pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock before
      him; and he saw and heard, he did quake and tremble exceedingly. And it came to pass that he
      returned to his own house at Jerusalem; and he cast himself upon his bed, being overcome with
      the spirit and the things which he had seen; and being thus overcome with the spirit, he was
      carried away in a vision, even that he saw the Heavens open; and he thought he saw God sitting
      upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels in the attitude of singing
      and praising their God. And it came to pass that he saw one descending out of the midst of
      Heaven, and he beheld that his lustre was above that of the sun at noon-day; and he also saw
      twelve others following him, and their brightness did exceed that of the stars in the
      firmament; and they came down and went forth upon the face of the earth; and the first came
      and stood before my father, and gave unto him a Book, and bade him that he should read. And it
      came to pass as he read, he was filled with the spirit of the Lord, and he read saying, Wo, wo
      unto Jerusalem! for I have seen thine abominations; yea, and many things did my father read
      concerning Jerusalem --that it should be destroyed, and the inhabitants thereof, many should
      perish by the sword, and many should be carried away captive into Babylon. And it came to pass
      that when my father had read and saw many great and marvellous things, he did exclaim many
      things unto the Lord; such as, Great and marvellous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty! Thy
      throne is high in the Heavens, and the power and goodness, and mercy is over all the
      inhabitants of the earth; and because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who come
      unto thee that they shall perish! And after this manner was the language of my father in the
      praising of his God; for his soul did rejoice, and his whole heart was filled, because of the
      things which he had seen; yea, which the Lord had shewn unto him. And now I, Nephi, do not
      make a full account of the things which my father hath written, for he hath written many
      things which he saw in visions and in dreams; and he also hath written many things which he
      prophesied and spake unto his children, of which I shall not make a full account; but I will
      make an account of my proceedings in my days --Behold I make an abridgement of the record of
      my father, upon plates which I have made with mine own hands; wherefore, after that I have
      abridged the record of my father, then will I make an account of mine own life. Therefore, I
      would that ye should know that after the Lord had shewn marvellous things unto my father Lehi,
      yea, concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, behold he went forth among the people and began
      to prophesy and to declare unto them concerning the things which he had both seen and heard.
      And it came to pass that the Jews did not mock him because of the things which he testified of
      them; for he truly testified of their wickedness and their abominations; and he testified that
      the things which he saw and heard, and also the things which he read in the Book, manifested
      plainly of the coming of a Messiah, and also the redemption of the world. And when the Jews
      heard these things, they were angry with him; yea, even as with the prophets of old, whom they
      had cast out and stoned and slain; and they also sought his life, that they might take it
      away. But behold, I, Nephi will shew unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord is over all
      them whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of
      deliverance. </text>

    <text> For behold it came to pass that the Lord spake unto my father., yea, even in a dream, and
      sayeth unto him, Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the things which thou hast done; and
      because thou hast been faithful and declared unto this people the things which I commanded
      thee, behold they seek to take away thy life. And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my
      father even in a dream, that he should take his family and depart into the wilderness. And it
      came to pass that he was obedient unto the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as the Lord
      commanded him. And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. --And he left his
      house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things,
      and took nothing with him save it were his family, and provisions, and tents, and he departed
      into the wilderness; and he came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea; and he
      travelled in the wilderness, in the borders, which was nearer the Red Sea; and he did travel
      in the wilderness with his family, which consisted of my mother, Sariah, and my elder
      brothers, which were Laman, Lemuel and Sam. And it came to pass that when he had travelled
      three days in the wilderness, he pitched his tent in a valley beside a river of water. And it
      came to pass that he built an altar of stones, and he made an offering unto the Lord, and gave
      thanks unto the Lord our God. And it came to pass that he called the name of the river Laman,
      and it emptied into the Red Sea; and the valley was in the borders near the mouth thereof. And
      when my father saw that the waters of the river emptied into the fountain of the Red Sea, he
      spake unto Laman, saying: O that thou mightest be like unto this river, continually running
      into the fountain of all righteousness. And he also spake unto Lemuel: O that thou mightest be
      like unto this valley, firm, and steadfast, and immoveable in keeping the commandments of the
      Lord. Now this he spake because of the stiffneckedness of Laman and Lemuel; for behold; they
      did murmur in many things against their father, because that he was a visionary man, and that
      he had led them out of the land of Jerusalem, to leave the land of their inheritance, and
      their gold, and their silver, and their precious things, and to perish in the wilderness. And
      this they said he had done because of the foolish imaginations of his heart. And thus Laman
      and Lemuel, being the eldest, did murmur against their father. --And they did murmur because
      they knew not the dealings of that God who had created them. Neither did they believe that
      Jerusalem, that great city, could be destroyed according to the words of the prophets. And
      they were like unto the Jews, which were at Jerusalem, which sought to take away the life of
      my father. And it came to pass that my father did speak unto them in the valley of Lemuel,
      with power, being filled with the spirit, until their frames did shake before him. And he did
      confound them, that they durst not utter against him; wherefore they did do as he commanded
      them. And my father dwelt in a tent. And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceeding young,
      nevertheless being large in stature, and also having great desires to know of the mysteries of
      God, wherefore I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart
      that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father; wherefore I did not rebel
      against him like unto my brothers. And I spake unto Sam, making known unto him the things
      which the Lord had manifested unto me by his Holy Spirit. And it came to pass that he believed
      in my words; but behold Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto my words: And being grieved
      because of the hardness of their hearts, I cried unto the Lord for them. And it came to pass
      that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy faith, for thou
      hast sought me diligently, with lowiness of heart. And inasmuch as ye shall keep my
      commandments, ye shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land which
      I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands. And inasmuch as
      thy brethren shall rebel against thee, they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.
      And inasmuch as thou shalt keep my commandments, thou shalt be made a ruler and a teacher over
      thy brethren. For behold, in that day that they shall rebel against me. I will curse them even
      with a sore curse, and they shall have no power over thy seed, except they shall rebel against
      me also. And if it so be that they rebel against me, they shall be a scourge unto thy seed, to
      stir them up in the way of remembrance. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that I, Nephi, returned from speaking with the Lord, to the tent of
      my father. And it came to pass that he spake unto me, saying: Behold I have dreamed a dream,
      in the which the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brethren shall return to Jerusalem.
      For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews, and also a genealogy of my forefathers, and
      they are engraven upon the plates of brass. Wherefore the Lord hath commanded me that thou and
      thy brothers should go unto the house of Laban, and seek the records, and bring them down
      hither into the wilderness. And now, behold, thy brothers murmur, saying: It is a hard thing
      which I have required of them; but behold I have not required it of them, but it is commanded
      of the Lord. Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord, because thou hast
      not murmured. And it came to pass, that I, Nephi, said unto my father, I will go and do the
      things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the
      children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which
      he commandeth of them. And it came to pass that when my father had heard these words, he was
      exceeding glad, for he knew that I had been blessed of the Lord. And I, Nephi, and my
      brethren, took our journey in the wilderness with our tents, to go up to the land of
      Jerusalem. And it came to pass that when we had come up to the land of Jerusalem, I and my
      brethren did consult one with another; and we cast lots, which of us should go in unto the
      house of Laban. And it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman; and Laman went in unto the
      house of Laban and he talked with him as he sat in his house. And he desired of Laban the
      records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, which contained the genealogy of my
      father. And behold, it came to pass that Laban was angry, and thrust him out of his presence;
      and he would not that he should have records. Wherefore he said unto him, behold thou art a
      robber, and I will slay thee. But Laman fled out of his presence, and told the things which
      Laban had done, unto us. And we began to be exceeding sorrowful, and my brethren were about to
      return unto my father in the wilderness. But behold I said unto them, that as the Lord liveth,
      and as we live, we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness, until we have
      accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us. Wherefore let us be faithful in
      keeping the commandments of the Lord; therefore let us go down to the land of our father's
      inheritance, for behold he left gold and silver, and all manner of riches. And all this he
      hath done, because of the commandments of the Lord: for he knowing that Jerusalem must be
      destroyed, because of the wickedness of the people. For behold, they have rejected the words
      of the prophets --Wherefore if my father should dwell in the land after that he hath been
      commanded to flee out of the land, behold he would also perish. Wherefore it must needs be
      that he flee out of the land. And behold, it is wisdom in God that we should obtain these
      records, that we might preserve unto our children the language of our fathers; and also that
      we may preserve unto them the words which have been spoken by the mouth of all the holy
      prophets, which have been delivered unto them by the spirit and power of God, since the world
      began, even down unto the present time. And it came to pass that after this manner of language
      did I persuade my brethren, that they might be faithful in keeping the commandments of God.
      And it came to pass that we went down to the land of our inheritance, and we did gather
      together our gold, and our silver, and our precious things. And after that we had gathered
      these things together, we went up again unto the house of Laban. And it came to pass that we
      went in unto Laban, and desired him that he would give unto us the records which were engraven
      upon the plates of brass, for which we would give unto him our gold, and our silver, and all
      our precious things. And it came to pass that when Laban saw our property, and that it was
      exceeding great, he did lust after it, insomuch that he thrust us out, and sent his servants
      to slay us, that he might obtain our property. And it came to pass that we did flee before the
      servants of Laban, and we were obliged to leave behind our property, and it fell into the
      hands of Laban. And it came to pass that we fled into the wilderness, and the servants of
      Laban did not overtake us, and we hid ourselves in the cavity of a rock. And it came to pass
      that Laman was angry with me, and also with my father; and also Lemuel; for he hearkened unto
      the words of Laman. Wherefore Laman and Lemuel did speak many hard words unto us, their
      younger brothers, and they did smite us even with a rod. And it came to pass as they smote us
      with a rod, behold an angel of the Lord came and stood before them, and he spake unto them
      saying: Why do ye smite your younger brother with a rod? Know ye not that the Lord hath chosen
      him to be a ruler over you , and this because of your iniquities? Behold thou shalt go up to
      Jerusalem again, and the Lord will deliver Laban into your hands. And after that the angel had
      spoken unto us, he departed. And after that angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel again began
      to murmur, saying, how is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Behold
      he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?

    <text> And it came to pass that I spake unto my brethren, saying: Let us go up again unto
      Jerusalem, and let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is
      mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his fifty yea, or even than
      his tens of thousands. Therefore let us go up; let us be strong like unto Moses: For he truly
      spake unto the waters of the Red Sea, and they divided hither and thither, and our fathers
      came through out of captivity on dry ground, and the armies of Pharaoh did follow and were
      drowned in the waters of the Red Sea. Now behold ye know that this is true; and ye also know
      that an angel hath spoken unto you, wherefore can ye doubt. Let us go up; the Lord is able to
      deliver us, even as our fathers, and to destroy Laban, even as the Egyptians. Now when I had
      spoken these words, they were yet wroth, and still did continue to murmur; Nevertheless they
      did follow me up until we came without the walls of Jerusalem. And it was by night; and I
      caused that they should hide themselves without the walls. And after that they had hid
      themselves, I, Nephi, crept into the city and went forth towards the house of Laban. And I was
      led by the spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do. Nevertheless I went
      forth, and as I came near the house of Laban, I beheld a man, and he had fallen to the earth
      before me, for he was drunken with wine. And when I came to him, I found that it was Laban.
      And I beheld his sword, and I drew it forth from the sheath thereof, and the hilt thereof was
      of pure gold, and the workmanship thereof was exceeding fine; and I saw that the blade thereof
      was of the most precious steel. And it came to pass that I was constrained by the spirit that
      I should kill Laban; but I said in my heart, never at any time have I shed blood of man, and I
      shrunk and would that I might not slay him. And the spirit saith unto me again, behold the
      Lord hath delivered him into thy hands; yea, and I also knew that he had sought to take away
      mine own life; yea, and he would not hearken unto the commandments of the Lord; and he also
      had taken away our property. And it came to pass that the spirit said unto me again, slay him,
      for the Lord hath delivered him into my hands. Behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring
      forth his righteous purposes: it is better that one man should perish, than that a nation
      should dwindle and perish in unbelief. And now, when I, Nephi, had heard these words, I
      remembered the words of the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness, saying, that
      inasmuch as thy seed shall keep my commandments, they shall prosper in the land of promise.
      --Yea, and I also thought that they could not keep the commandments of the Lord according to
      the law of Moses, save they should have the law. And I also knew that the law was engraven
      upon the plates of brass. And again --I knew that the Lord had delivered Laban into my hands,
      for this cause: that I might obtain the records according to his commandments. Therefore I did
      obey the voice of the spirit, and took Laban by the hair of the head, and I smote off his head
      with his own sword. And after that I had smitten off his head with his own sword, I took the
      garments of Laban and put them upon mine own body; yea, even every whit; and I did gird on his
      armour about my loins. And after that I had done this, I went forth unto the treasury of
      Laban, And as I went forth towards the treasury of Laban, behold I saw the servant of Laban
      which had the keys of the treasury. And I commanded him in the voice of Laban, that he should
      go with me into the treasury; and he supposed me to be his master, Laban, for he beheld the
      garments, and also the sword girted about my loins. And he spake unto me concerning the elders
      of the Jews, he knowing that his master Laban had been out by night among them. And I spake
      unto him as if it had been Laban. And I also spake unto him that I should carry the engravings
      which were upon the plates of brass, to my elder brethren, which were without the walls. And I
      also bade him that he should follow me. And he, supposing that I spake of the brethren of the
      church, and that I was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he did follow me. And he
      spake unto me many times concerning the elders of the Jews, as I went forth unto my brethren,
      which were without walls. And it came to pass that when Laman saw me, he was exceedingly
      frightened, and also Lemuel and Sam. And they fled from before my presence; for they supposed
      it was Laban, and that he had slain me, and had sought to take away their lives also. And it
      came to pass that I called after them, and they did hear me; wherefore they did cease to flee
      from my presence. And it came to pass that when the servant of Laban beheld my brethren, he
      began to tremble, and was about to flee from before me and return to the city of Jerusalem.
      And now I, Nephi, being a man large in stature, and also having received much strength of the
      Lord, therefore I did seize upon the servant of Laban, and held him, that he should not flee.
      And it came to pass that I spake with him, that if he would hearken unto my words, as the Lord
      liveth and as I live, even so that if he would hearken unto our words, we would spare his
      life. And I spake unto him, even with an oath, that he need not fear; that he should be a free
      man like unto us, if he would go down in the wilderness with us. And I also spake unto him,
      saying, surely the Lord hath commanded us to do this thing. And shall we not be diligent in
      keeping the commandments of the Lord? therefore, if thou wilt go down into the wilderness to
      my father, thou shalt have place with us. And it came to pass that Zoram did take courage at
      the words which I spake. Now Zoram was the name of the servant; and he promised that he would
      go down into the wilderness unto our father. And he also made an oath unto us, that he would
      tarry with us from that time forth. Now we were desirous that we should tarry with us for this
      cause: that the Jews might not know concerning our flight into the wilderness, lest they
      should pursue us and destroy us. And it came to pass that when Zoram had made an oath unto us,
      our fears did cease concerning him. And it came to pass that we took the plates of brass and
      the servant of Laban, and departed into the wilderness, and journied into the tent of our
      father. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass after we had came down into the wilderness unto our father, behold he
      was filled with joy, and also my mother, Sariah, was exceeding glad, for she truly had mourned
      because of us; for she had supposed that we had perished in the wilderness; and she also had
      complained against my father, telling him that he was a visionary man; saying, behold thou
      hast led us forth from the land of our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we perish in
      the wilderness. And after this manner of language had my mother complained against my father.
      And it came to pass that my father spake unto her saying: I know that I am a visionary man;
      for if I had not seen the things of God in a vision, I should not have known the goodness of
      God, but had tarried at Jerusalem and had perished with my children. But behold, I have
      obtained a land of promise, in the which thing I do rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord
      will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto us in the
      wilderness. And after this manner of language did my father Lehi comfort my mother Sariah,
      concerning us, while we journied in the wilderness up to the land of Jerusalem, to obtain the
      record of the Jews. And when we had returned to the tent of my father, behold their joy was
      full, and my mother was comforted; and she spake, saying: Now I know of a surety that the Lord
      hath commanded my husband to flee into the wilderness; yea, and I also know of a surety that
      the Lord hath protected my sons and delivered them out of the hands of Laban, and gave them
      power whereby they could accomplish the thing which the Lord hath commanded them. And after
      this language did she speak. And it came to pass that they did rejoice exceedingly, and did
      offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto the Lord; and they gave thanks unto the God of
      Israel. And after that they had given thanks unto the God of Israel, my father Lehi took the
      records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, and he did search them from the
      beginning. And he beheld that they did contain the five books of Moses, which gave an account
      of the creation of the world, and also of Adam and Eve, which was our first parents; and also
      a record of Jews from the beginning, even down to the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah,
      King of Judah; and also the prophecies of the Holy prophets, from the beginning, even down to
      the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah; and also many prophecies which have been spoken by
      the mouth of Jeremiah. And it came to pass that my father Lehi also found upon the plates of
      brass, a genealogy of his fathers; wherefore he knew that he was a descendant of Joseph; yea,
      even that Joseph which was the son of Jacob, which was sold into Egypt, and which was
      preserved by the hand of the Lord, that he might preserve his father Jacob and all his
      household from perishing with famine. And they were also led out of captivity and out of the
      land of Egypt, by the same God who had preserved them. And thus my father Lehi did discover
      the genealogy of his fathers. And Laban also was a descendant of Joseph, wherefore he and his
      fathers had kept the records. And now when my father saw all these things, he was filled with
      the spirit, and began to prophesy concerning his seed; that these plates of brass should go
      forth unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people which were of his seed. Wherefore he
      said that these plates of brass should never perish; neither should they be dimmed any more by
      time. And he prophesied many times concerning his seed. And it came to pass that thus far I
      and my father had kept the commandments wherewith the Lord had commanded us. And we had
      obtained the record which the Lord had commanded us, and searched them and found that they
      were desirable yea, even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the
      commandments of the Lord unto our children. Wherefore it was wisdom in the Lord that we should
      carry them with us, as we journied in the wilderness towards the land of promise. </text>

    <text> And now I, Nephi, do not give the genealogy of my fathers in this part of my record;
      neither at any time shall I give it after upon these plates which I am writing; for it is
      given in the record which has been kept by my father; wherefore I do not write it in this
      work. For it sufficeth me to say, that we are a descendant of Joseph. And it mattereth not to
      me that I am particular to give a full account of all things of my father, for they cannot be
      written upon these plates, for I desire the room, that I may write of the things of God. For
      the fullness of mine intent is that I may persuade men to come unto the God of Abraham, and
      the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and be saved. Wherefore the things which are pleasing
      unto the world, I do not write, but the things which are pleasing unto God and unto them which
      are not of the world. Wherefore I shall give commandment unto my seed, that they shall not
      occupy these plates with things which are not of worth unto the children of men. </text>

    <text> And now I would that ye might know, that after my father Lehi had made an end of
      prophesying concerning his seed, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto him again, saying,
      that it was not mete for him, Lehi, that he should take his family into the wilderness alone;
      but that his sons should take daughters to wife that they might raise up seed unto the Lord in
      the land of promise. And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him that I, Nephi, and my
      brethren, should again return unto the land of Jerusalem, and bring down Ishmael and his
      family into the wilderness, And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did again, with my brethren, go
      forth into the wilderness to go up to Jerusalem. And it came to pass that we went up unto the
      house of Ishmael, and we did gain favor in the sight of Ishmael, insomuch that we did speak
      unto him the words of the Lord. And it came to pass that the Lord did soften the heart of
      Ishmael, and also his household, insomuch that they took their journey with us down into the
      wilderness to the tent of our father. And it came to pass as we journied in the wilderness,
      behold, Laman and Lemuel, and two of the daughters of Ishmael, and the two sons of Ishmael,
      and their families, did rebel against us; yea, against I, Nephi, and Sam, and their father,
      Ishmael, and his wife, and his three other daughters. And it came to pass in the which
      rebellion, they were desirous to return unto the land of Jerusalem. And now I, Nephi, being
      grieved for the hardness of their hearts, therefore I spake unto them, saying; yea, even unto
      Laman and unto Lemuel, behold, thou art mine elder brethren; and how is it that ye are so hard
      in your hearts, and so blind in your minds, that ye have need that I, your younger brother,
      should speak unto you, yea, and set an example for you? How is it that ye have not hearkened
      unto the word of the Lord? How is it that ye have forgotten that ye have seen an angel of the
      Lord? Yea, and how is it that ye have forgotten how great things the Lord hath done for us in
      delivering us out of the hands of Laban, and also that we should obtain the record? Yea, and
      how is it that ye have forgotten that the Lord is able to do all things, according to his
      will, for the children of men, if it so be that they exercise faith in him; wherefore, let us
      be faithful in him. And if it so be that we are faithful in him, we shall obtain the land of
      promise; and ye shall know at some future period, that the word of the Lord shall be
      fulfilled, concerning the destruction of Jerusalem; for all things which the Lord hath spoken
      concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, must be fulfilled. For, behold, the spirit of the
      Lord ceaseth soon to strive with them; for behold, they have rejected the prophets, and
      Jeremiah have they cast into prison. And they have sought to take away the life of my father,
      insomuch that they have driven him out of the land. Now behold, I say unto you, that if ye
      will return unto Jerusalem, ye shall also perish with them. And now, if ye have choice, go up
      to the land, and remember the words which I speak unto you, that if ye go, ye will also
      perish; for thus the spirit of the Lord constraineth me that I should speak. And it came to
      pass that when I, Nephi, had spoken these words unto my brethren, they were angry with me. And
      it came to pass that they did lay their hands upon me; for, behold, they were exceeding wroth;
      and they did bind me with cords, for they sought to take away my life, that they might leave
      me in the wilderness, to be devoured by wild beasts. But it came to pass that I prayed unto
      the Lord, saying: O Lord, according to my faith which is in thee, wilt thou deliver me from
      the hands of my brethren; yea, even give me strength that I may burst these bands with which I
      am bound. And it came to pass that when I had said these words, behold, the bands were loosed
      from off my hands and feet, and I stood before my brethren, and I spake unto them again. And
      it came to pass that they were angry with me again, and sought to lay hands upon me; but,
      behold, one of the daughters of Ishmael, yea, and also her mother, and one of the sons of
      Ishmael, did plead with my brethren; and they did cease striving to take away my life. And it
      came to pass that they were sorrowful, because of their wickedness, insomuch that they did bow
      down before me, and did plead with me, that I would forgive them of the thing that they had
      done against me. And it came to pass that I did frankly forgive them all that they had done,
      and I did exhort them that they would pray unto the Lord their God, for forgiveness. And it
      came to pass that they did so. And after that they had done praying unto the Lord, we did
      again travel on our journey toward the tent of our father. And it came to pass that we did
      come down unto the tent of our father. And after that I and my brothers, and all the house of
      Ishmael, had come down unto the tent of my father, they did give thanks unto the Lord their
      God; and they did offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto him. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that we had gathered together all manner of seeds of every kind; both
      of grain of every kind, and also of the seeds of fruits of every kind. And it came to pass
      that while my father tarried in the wilderness, he spake unto ,us, saying: Behold, I have
      dreamed a dream; or, in other words, I have seen a vision. And behold, because of the thing
      which I have seen, I have reason to rejoice in the Lord, because of Nephi, and also of Sam,
      for I have reason to suppose that they, and also many of their seed, will be saved. --But,
      behold, Laman and Lemuel, I fear exceedingly, because of you; for, behold, me thought I saw a
      dark and dreary wilderness. And it came to pass that I saw a man, and he was dressed in a
      white robe; and he came and stood before me. And it came to pass that he spake unto me, and
      bade me follow him. And it came to pass that as I followed him, and after I had followed him,
      I beheld myself that I was in the dark and dreary waste. And after that I travelled for the
      space of many hours in darkness, I began to pray unto the Lord, that he would have mercy on
      me, according to the multitude of his tender mercies. And it came to pass that after I had
      prayed unto the Lord, I beheld a large and spacious field. And it came to pass that I beheld a
      tree, whose fruit was desirable, to make one happy. And it came to pass that I did go forth,
      and partake of the fruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all that I ever
      had before tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the fruit thereof was white, to exceed all the
      whiteness that I had ever seen. And as I partook of the fruit thereof, it filled my soul with
      exceeding great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it
      also; for I knew that it was desirous above all other fruit. And as I cast my eyes round
      about, that perhaps I might discover my family also, I beheld a river of water; and it ran
      along, and it was near the tree of which I was partaking the fruit. And I looked to behold
      from whence it came; and I saw the head thereof, a little way off; and at the head thereof, I
      beheld your mother Sariah, and Sam, and Nephi; and they stood as if they knew not whither they
      should go. And it came to pass that I beckoned unto them; and I also did say unto them, with a
      loud voice, that they should come unto me, and partake of the fruit, which was desirable above
      all other fruit. And it came to pass that they did come unto me, and partake of the fruit
      also. And it came to pass that I was desirous that Laman and Lemuel should come and partake of
      the fruit also; wherefore, I cast mine eyes towards the head of the river, that perhaps I
      might see them. And it came to pass that I saw them, but they would not come unto me. And I
      beheld a rod of iron; and it extended along the bank of the river, and led to the tree by
      which I stood. And I also beheld a straight and narrow path which came along by the rod of
      iron, even to the tree by which I stood; and it also led by the head of the fountain, unto a
      large and spacious field, as if it had been a world; and I saw numberless concourses of
      people; many of whom were pressing forward, that they might obtain the path which led unto the
      tree by which it stood. And it came to pass that they did come forth, and commence in the path
      which led to the tree. And it came to pass that there arose a mist of darkness; yea, even an
      exceeding great mist of darkness, insomuch that they which had commenced in the path, did lose
      their way, that they wandered off, and were lost. And it came to pass that I beheld others
      pressing forward; and they came forth, and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron, and they
      did press through the mist of darkness, clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come
      forth and partake of the fruit of the tree. And after that they had partaken of the fruit of
      the tree, they did cast their eyes about as it they were ashamed. And I also cast my eyes
      round about, and beheld, on the other side of the river of water, a great and spacious
      building; and it stood as it were in the air, high above the earth; and it was filled with
      people, both old and young, both male and female; and their number of dress was exceeding
      fine; and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards those which
      had come at, and were partaking of the fruit. And after that they had tasted of the fruit,
      they were ashamed, because of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away into
      forbidden paths, and were lost. And now I, Nephi, do not speak all the words of my father. But
      to be short in writing: Behold, he saw other multitudes pressing forward; and they came and
      caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press their way forward, continually
      holding fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth and fell down, and partook of the fruit
      of the tree. And he also saw other multitudes, feeling their way towards that great and
      spacious building. And it came to pass that many were drowned in the depths of the fountain;
      and many were lost from his view, wandering in strange roads. And great was the multitude that
      did enter into that strange building. And after that they did enter into that building, they
      did point the finger of scorn at me, and those that were partaking of the fruit also; but we
      heeded them not. These are the words of my father: For as many as heeded them, had fallen
      away. And Laman and Lemuel partook not of the fruit, saith my father. And it came to pass that
      after my father had spoken all the words of his dream or vision, which were many, he said unto
      us, because of these things which he saw in a vision. he exceedingly feared for Laman and
      Lemuel; yea, he feared lest they should be cast off from the presence of the Lord; and he did
      not exhort them then with all the feeling of a tender parent, that they would hearken to his
      words, in that, perhaps the Lord would be merciful to them, and not cast them off; yea, my
      father did preach unto them. And after he had preached unto them, and also prophesied unto
      them of many things, he bade them to keep the commandments of the Lord; and he did cease
      speaking unto them. </text>

    <text> And all these things did my father see, and hear, and speak, as he dwelt in a tent, in
      the valley of Lemuel; and also a great many more things, which cannot be written upon these
      plates. And now, as I have spoken concerning these plates, behold, they are not the plates
      upon which I make a full account of the history of my people, I have given the name of Nephi;
      wherefore, they are called the plates of Nephi, after mine own name; and these plates also,
      are called the plates of Nephi. Nevertheless, I have received a commandment of the Lord, that
      I should make these plates, for the special purpose that there should be an account engraven
      of the ministry of my people. Upon the other plates should be engraven an account of the reign
      of the Kings, and the wars, and contentions of my people; wherefore, these plates are, for the
      more part, of the ministry; and the other plates are, for the more part, of the reign of the
      Kings, and the wars, and the contentions of my people. Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me
      to make these plates, for a wise purpose in him; which purpose, I know not. Behold the Lord
      knoweth all things, from the beginning; wherefore, he prepareth a way to accomplish all his
      works among the children of men; for behold, he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all his
      words. And thus it is. Amen. </text>

    <text> And now I, Nephi, proceed to give an account upon these plates, of my proceedings, and my
      reign and ministry; therefore, to proceed with mine account. I must speak somewhat of the
      things of my father, and also of my brethren. For behold, it came to pass that after my father
      had made an end of speaking the words of his dream, and also exhorting them to all diligence,
      he spake unto them concerning the Jews: How that after they were destroyed, yea, even that
      great city Jerusalem; and that many were carried away captive into Babylon; that according to
      the own due time of the Lord, they should return again; yea, even be brought back out of
      captivity; and after they are brought back out of captivity, to possess again the land of
      their inheritance. Yea, even six hundred years from the time that my father left Jerusalem, a
      Prophet would the Lord God raise up among the Jews; yea, even a Messiah; or, in other words, a
      Saviour of the world. And he also spake concerning the prophets: How great a number had
      testified of these things, concerning this Messiah, of which he had spoken, or this Redeemer
      of the world. Wherefore, all mankind was in a lost and in a fallen state; and ever would be,
      save they should rely on this Redeemer. And he spake also, concerning a prophet, which should
      come before the Messiah, to prepare the way of the Lord; yea, even he should go forth and cry
      in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for there
      standeth one among you whom ye know not; and he is mightier than I, whose shoe's latchet I am
      not worthy to unloose. And much spake my father concerning this thing. And my father saith
      that he should baptise in Bethabara, beyond Jordan; and he also spake, that he should baptise
      with water. yea, even that he should baptise the Messiah with water. And after that he had
      baptised the Messiah with water, he should behold and bear record, that he had baptised the
      Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of the world. And it came to pass that after my
      father had spoken these words, he spake unto my brethren concerning the Gospel, which should
      be preached among the Jews; and also, concerning the dwindling of the Jews in unbelief. And
      after that they had slain the Messiah which should come, and after that he had been slain, he
      should rise from the dead, and should make himself manifest, by the Holy Ghost, unto the
      Gentiles. Yea, even my father spake much concerning the Gentiles, and also concerning the
      House of Israel: that they should be compared like unto an olive tree, whose branches should
      be broken off, and should be scattered upon all the face of the earth. Wherefore, he said, it
      must needs be that we should be led with one accord, into the land of promise, unto the
      fulfilling of the word of the Lord: That we should be scattered upon all the face of the
      earth. And after that the house of Israel should be scattered, they should be gathered
      together again; or, in fine, that after the Gentiles had received the fulness of the Gospel,
      the natural branches of the olive tree, or the remnants of the House of Israel, should be
      grafted in, or come to the knowledge of the true Messiah, their Lord and their Redeemer. And
      after this manner of language did my father prophesy ,and speak unto my brethren; and also,
      many more things, which I do not write in this book: for I have written as many of them, as
      were expedient for me, in mine other book: And all these things of which I have spoken, was
      done, as my father dwelt in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel. And it came to pass that after I,
      Nephi, having heard all the words of my father, concerning the things which he saw in a
      vision; and also the things which he spake by the power of the Holy Ghost; which power, he
      received by faith on the Son of God. And the Son of God was the Messiah, which should come.
      And it came to pass that I, Nephi, was desirous also, that I might see, and hear, and know of
      these things, by the power of the Holy Ghost, which is the gift of God unto all those who
      diligently seek him, as well in times of old in the time that he should manifest himself unto
      the children of men; for he is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever; and the way is
      prepared from the foundation of the world, if it so be that they repent and come unto him; for
      he that diligently seeketh, shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them,
      by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times, as in times of old; and as well as in
      times of old, as in times to come; wherefore, the courses of the Lord is one eternal round.
      Therefore, remember, O man, for all thy doings, thou shalt be brought into judgment.
      Wherefore, if ye have sought to do wickedly before the judgment seat of God; and no unclean
      thing can dwell with God; wherefore, ye must be cast off forever. And the Holy Ghost giveth
      authority that I should speak these things, and deny them not. </text>

    <text> For it came to pass that after I had desired to know the things that my father had seen,
      and believing that the Lord was able to make them known unto me; wherefore, as I sat pondering
      in mine heart, I was caught away in the spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceeding high
      mountain, which I, never had before seen, and upon which I never had before sat my foot. And
      the spirit saith unto me, Behold, what desirest thou? And I saith, I desire to behold the
      things which my father saw. And the spirit saith unto me, Believest thou that thy father saw
      the tree of which he hath spoken? And I said yea; thou knowest that I believe all the words of
      my father. And when I had spoken these words, the spirit cried with a loud voice, saying:
      Hosanna to the Lord, the most high God; for he is God over all the earth, yea, even above all;
      and blessed art thou, Nephi, because thou believest in the Son of the Most High God;
      wherefore, thou shalt behold the things which thou desired. And behold, this thing shall be
      given unto thee for a sign: that after thou hast beheld the tree which bore the fruit which
      thy father tasted, thou shalt also behold a man descending out of Heaven, and him shall ye
      witness; and after that ye have witnessed him, ye shall bear record that it is the Son of God.
      And it came to pass that the spirit saith unto me, look! and I looked and beheld the tree; and
      it was like unto the tree which my father had seen; and the beauty thereof was far beyond,
      yea, exceeding of all beauty; and the whiteness thereof, did exceed the whiteness of the
      driven snow. And it came to pass that after that I had seen the tree, I said unto the spirit,
      I behold thou hast shewn unto me the tree which is precious above all. And he saith unto me,
      What desirest thou? And I said unto him, to know the interpretation thereof; for I spake unto
      him as a man speaketh; for I beheld that he was in the form of a man; yet, nevertheless, I
      knew that it was the spirit of the Lord; and he spake unto me as a man speaketh with another.
      And it came to pass that he said unto me, look: And I looked as if to look upon him, and I saw
      him not; for he had gone from before my presence. And it came to pass that I looked and beheld
      the great city Jerusalem, and also other cities. And I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the
      city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was exceeding fair and white. And it came to pass
      that I saw the Heavens open; and an angel came down and stood before me; and he saith unto me,
      Nephi, what beholdest thou? And I saith unto him, a virgin, most beautiful and fair above all
      other virgins. And he saith unto me, Knowest thou condescention of God? And I said unto him, I
      know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things. And
      he said unto me, Behold, the virgin which thou seest, is the mother of God, after the manner
      of flesh. And it came to pass I beheld that she was carried away in the spirit; and after that
      she had been carried away in the spirit for the space of time, the angel spake unto me,
      saying, look! And I looked and beheld the virgin again, bearing a child in her arms. And the
      angel said unto me, behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Eternal Father! Knowest thou the
      meaning of the tree which thy father saw? And I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love of
      God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the
      most desirable above all things. And he spake unto me, saying, Yea, and the most joyous to the
      soul. And after that he had said those words, he said unto me, look! And I looked, and I
      beheld the Son of God going forth among the children of men; and I saw many fall down at his
      feet and worship him. And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron which my father
      had seen, was the word of God, which let to the fountain of living waters, or to the tree of
      life; which waters are a representation of the love of God; and I also beheld that the tree of
      life was a representation of the love of God. And the angel said unto me again, Look and
      behold the condescention of God! And I looked and beheld the Redeemer of the world, of which
      my father had spoken; and I also beheld the prophet, which should prepare the way before him.
      And the Lamb of God went forth, and was baptised of him; and after that he was baptised, I
      beheld the Heavens open, and the Holy Ghost come down out of Heaven and abode upon him in the
      form of a dove. And I beheld that he went forth ministering unto the people, in power and
      great glory; and the multitudes were gathered together to hear him; and I beheld that they
      cast him out from among them. And I also beheld twelve others following him. And it came to
      pass that they were carried away in the spirit, from before my face, that I saw them not. And
      it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying, look! And I looked, and I beheld
      the Heavens open again, and I saw angels descending upon the children of men; and they did
      minister unto them. And he spake unto me again, saying. look! And I looked, and beheld the
      Lamb of God going forth among the children of men. And I beheld multitudes of people which
      were sick, and which were afflicted of all manner of diseases, and with devils, and unclean
      spirits; and the angel spake, and shewed all these things unto me. And they were healed by the
      power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out. And it came to
      pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying, look! And I looked and beheld the Lamb of
      God, that he was taken by the people; yea, the Everlasting God, was judged of the world; and I
      saw and bear record. And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross, and slain for the
      sins of the world. And after that he was slain, I saw the multitudes of the earth, that they
      were gathered together to fight against the apostles of the Lamb; for thus were the twelve
      called by the angel of the Lord. And the multitude of the earth was gathered together; and I
      beheld that they were in a large spacious building, like unto the building which my father
      saw. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying, Behold the world and the wisdom
      thereof; yea, behold, the House of Israel hath gathered together, to fight against the twelve
      apostles of the Lamb. And it came to pass I saw and bear record, that the great and spacious
      building was the pride of the world; and it fell; and the fall thereof was exceeding great.
      And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Thus shall be the destruction of all
      nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that shall fight against the twelve apostles of the
      Lamb. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that the angel said unto me, Look, and behold thy seed, and also the
      seed of thy brethren! And I looked and beheld the land of promise; and I beheld multitudes of
      people, yea, even as it were in number, as many as the sand of the sea. And it came to pass
      that I beheld multitudes gathered together, to battle one against the other; and I beheld
      wars, and rumors of wars, and great slaughters with the sword among my people. And it came to
      pass that I beheld many generations pass away after the manner of wars and contentions in the
      land; and I beheld many cities, yea, even that I did not number them. And it came to pass that
      I saw a mist of darkness on the face of the land of promise; and I saw lightnings, and I heard
      thunderings, and earthquakes, and all manner of tumultuous noises; and I saw the earth and the
      rocks, that rent; and I saw mountains tumbling into pieces; and I saw the plains of the earth.
      that they were broken up; and I saw many cities, that they were sunk; and I saw many, that
      they were burned with fire; And I saw many, that they did tumble to earth, because of the
      quaking thereof. And it came to pass that after I saw these things, I saw the vapor of
      darkness, that it passed from off the face of the earth; and behold, I saw the multitudes
      which had fallen, because of the great and terrible judgments of the Lord. And I saw the
      Heavens open, and the Lamb of God descending out of Heaven; and he came down and shewed
      himself unto them. And I also saw and bear record, that the Holy Ghost fell upon twelve
      others; and they were ordained of God, and chosen. And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold
      the twelve disciples of the Lamb, which are chosen to minister unto thy seed. And he saith
      unto me, Thou remembereth the twelve apostles of the Lamb? Behold, they are they which shall
      judge the twelve tribes of Israel; wherefore, the twelve ministers of thy seed, shall be
      judged of them; for ye are of the house of Israel; and these twelve ministers which thou
      beholdest, shall judge thy seed. And behold, they are righteous forever; for because of their
      faith in the Lamb of God, their garments are made white in his blood. And the angel saith unto
      me, look! And I looked and beheld three generations did pass away in righteousness; and their
      garments were white, even like unto the Lamb of God. And the angel said unto me, These are
      made white in the blood of the Lamb, because of their faith in him. And I, Nephi, also many of
      the fourth generation, which did pass away in righteousness. And it came to pass that I saw
      the multitudes of the earth gathered together. And the angel said unto me, Behold they seed,
      and also the seed of thy brethren! And it came to pass that I looked, and beheld the people of
      my seed gathered together in multitudes against the seed of my brethren; and they were
      gathered together in battle. And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the fountain of
      filthy water which thy father saw; yea, even the river of which he spake; and the depths
      thereof, are the depths of hell; and the mists of darkness, are the temptations of the devil,
      which blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men, and leadeth them
      away into broad roads, that they may perish, and are lost; and the large and spacious building
      which thy father saw, is vain imaginations, and the pride of the children of men. And a great
      and terrible gulf divideth them; yea, even the word of the justice of the Eternal God, and
      Jesus Christ, which is the Lamb of God, of whom the Holy Ghost beareth record, from the
      beginning of the world until this time, and from this time henceforth and forever. And while
      the angel spoke these words, I beheld and saw that the seed of my brethren did contend against
      my seed, according to the word of the angel; and because of the pride of my seed, and the
      temptations of the devil, I beheld that the seed of my brethren did overpower the people of my
      seed. And it came to pass that I beheld and saw the people of the seed of my brethren, that
      they had overcome my seed; and they went forth in multitudes upon the face of the land. And I
      saw them gathered together in multitudes; and I saw wars, and rumors of wars among them; and
      in wars, and rumors of wars, I saw many generations pass away. And the angel said unto me,
      behold, these shall dwindle in unbelief. And it came to pass that I beheld that after they had
      dwindled in unbelief, they became a dark, and loathsome, and a filthy people, full of idleness
      and all manner of abominations. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me saying, look! And I looked and beheld
      many nations and kingdoms. And the angel saith unto me, what beholdest thou? And I said I
      behold many nations and kingdoms. And he saith unto me, these are the nations and kingdoms of
      the Gentiles. And it came to pass that I saw among the nations of the Gentiles, the foundation
      of a great church. And the angel said unto me, Behold the foundation of a church, which is
      most abominable above all churches, which slayeth the Saints of God, yea, and tortureth them
      and bindeth them down, and yoketh them with a yoke of iron, and bringeth them down into
      captivity. And it came to pass that I beheld this great and abominable church; and I saw the
      devil, that he was the founder of it. And I also saw gold, and silver, and silks, and
      scarlets, and fine twined linen, and all manner of precious clothing; and I saw many harlots.
      And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the gold, and the silver, and the silks, and the
      scarlets, and the fine twined linen, and the precious clothing, and the harlots, are the
      desires of this great and abominable church: and also for the praise of the world, do they
      destroy the Saints of God, and bring them down into captivity. And it came to pass that I
      looked and beheld many waters; and they divided the Gentiles from the seed of my brethren. And
      it came to pass that the angel said unto me, Behold, the wrath of God is upon the seed of thy
      brethren! And I looked and beheld a man among the Gentiles, which was separated from the seed
      of my brethren by the many waters; and I beheld the spirit of God, that it came down and
      wrought upon the man; and he went forth among the many waters, even unto the seed of my
      brethren, which were in the promised land. And it came to pass that I beheld the spirit of
      God, that it wrought upon other Gentiles; and they went forth out of captivity, upon the many
      waters. And it came to pass that I beheld many multitudes of the Gentiles, upon the land of
      promise; and I beheld the wrath of God, that it was upon the seed of my brethren; and they
      were scattered before the Gentiles, and they were smitten. And I beheld the spirit of the
      Lord, that it was upon the Gentiles; that they did prosper, and obtain the land of their
      inheritance; and I beheld that they were white, and exceeding fair and beautiful, like unto my
      people, before they were slain. And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles
      which had gone forth out of captivity, did humble themselves before the Lord; and the power of
      the Lord was with them; and I beheld that their mother Gentiles was gathered together upon the
      waters, and upon the land also, to battle against them, and I beheld that the power of God was
      with them; and also, that the wrath of God was upon them, that were gathered together against
      them to battle. And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles which had gone out of captivity, were
      delivered by the power of God, out of the hands of all other nations. And it came to pass that
      I, Nephi, beheld that they did prosper in the land, and I beheld a Book; and it was carried
      forth among them. And the angel saith unto me, Knowest thou the meaning of the Book? And I
      saith unto him, I know not. And he saith, Behold, it proceedeth out of the mouth of a Jew, and
      I, Nephi, beheld it; and he saith unto me, The Book which thou beholdest, is a record of the
      Jews, which contains the covenants of the Lord which he hath made unto the House of Israel;
      and it also containeth many of the prophesies of the Holy Prophets; and it is a record like
      unto the engravings which are upon the plates of brass, save there are not so many;
      nevertheless, they contain the covenants of the Lord, which he hath made unto the House of
      Israel; wherefore, they are of great worth unto the Gentiles. And the angel of the Lord said
      unto me, Thou hast beheld that the Book proceeded forth from the mouth of a Jew; and when it
      proceedeth from the mouth of a Jew, it contained the plainness of the Gospel of the Lord, of
      whom the twelve apostles bear record; and they bear record according to the truth which is in
      the Lamb of God; wherefore, these things go forth from the Jews in purity, unto the Gentiles,
      according to the truth which is in God; and after that they go forth by the hand of the twelve
      apostles of the Lamb, from the Jews unto the Gentiles; behold, after this, thou seest the
      foundation of a great and abominable church, which is the most abominable above all other
      churches; for behold, they have taken away from the Gospel of the Lamb, many parts which are
      plain and most precious; and also, many Covenants of the Lord have they taken away; and all
      this have they done, that they might pervert the right ways of the Lord; that they might blind
      the eyes and harden the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, thou seest that after the
      Book hath gone forth through the hands of the great and abominable church, that there are many
      plain and precious things taken away from the Book, which is the Book of the Lamb of God; and
      after that these plain and precious things were taken away, it goeth forth unto all the
      nations of the Gentiles; and after it goeth forth unto all the nations of the Gentiles, yea,
      even across the many waters which thou hast seen with the Gentiles which have gone forth out
      of captivity; and thou seest because of the many plain and precious things which have been
      taken out of the Book, which were plain unto the understanding of the children of men,
      according to the plainness which is in the Lamb of God; and because of these things which were
      taken away out of the Gospel of the Lamb, an exceeding great many do stumble, yea, insomuch
      that Satan hath great power over them; nevertheless thou beholdest that the Gentiles which
      have gone forth out of captivity, and have been lifted up by the power of God above all other
      nations upon the face of the Land, which is choice above all other lands, which is the land
      which the Lord God hath covenanted with thy father, that his seed should have, for the land of
      their inheritance; wherefore, thou seest that the Lord God will not suffer that the Gentiles
      will utterly destroy the mixture of thy seed, which is among thy brethren; neither will he
      suffer that the Gentiles shall destroy the seed of thy brethren; neither will the Lord God
      suffer that the Gentiles shall forever remain in that state of awful woundedness which thou
      beholdest that they are in, because of the plain and most precious parts of the Gospel of the
      Lamb which hath been kept back by the abominable church, whose formation thou hast seen;
      wherefore, saith the Lamb of God, I will be merciful unto the Gentiles, unto the visiting of
      the remnant of the House of Israel in great judgment. And it came to pass that the angel of
      the Lord spake unto me, saying: Behold, saith the Lamb of God, after that I have visited the
      remnant of the House of Israel, and this remnant of which I speak, is the seed of thy father;
      wherefore, after that I have visited them in judgment, and smitten them by the hand of the
      Gentiles; and after that the Gentiles do stumble exceedingly, because of the most plain and
      precious parts of the Gospel of the Lamb which hath been kept back, by that abominable church,
      which is the mother of harlots, saith the Lamb; wherefore, I will be merciful unto the
      Gentiles in that day, saith the Lamb, insomuch that I will bring forth unto them in mine own
      power, much of my Gospel, which shall be plain and precious, saith the Lamb; for behold, saith
      the Lamb, I will manifest myself unto thy seed, that they shall write many things which I
      shall minister unto them, which shall be plain and precious; and after that thy seed shall be
      destroyed and dwindle in unbelief, and also, the seed of thy brethren; behold, these things
      shall be hid up, to come forth unto the Gentiles, by the gift and power of the Lamb; and in
      them shall be written my Gospel, saith the Lamb, and my rock and my salvation; and blessed are
      they which shall seek to bring forth my Zion at that day, for they shall have the gift and the
      power of the Holy Ghost; and if they endure unto the end, they shall be lifted up at the last
      day, and shall be saved in the Everlasting Kingdom of the Lamb; yea, whoso shall publish
      peace, that shall publish tidings of great joy, how beautiful upon the mountains shall they
      be. And it came to pass that I beheld the remnant of the seed of my brethren, and also the
      book of the Lamb of God, which had proceeded forth from the mouth of the Jew; and I beheld
      that it came forth from the Gentiles, unto the remnant of the seed of my brethren; and after
      it had come forth unto them, I beheld other Books, which came forth by the power of the Lamb,
      from the Gentiles, unto them, unto the convincing of the Gentiles, and the remnant of the seed
      of my brethren, and also to the Jews, which were scattered upon all the face of the earth,
      that the records of the prophets and of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, are true. And the
      angel spake unto me, saying: These last records which thou hast seen among the Gentiles, shall
      establish the truth of the first, which is of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, and shall make
      known the plain and precious things which have been taken away from them; and shall make known
      to all kindreds, tongues, and people, that the Lamb of God is the Eternal Father and the
      Saviour of the world; and that all men must come unto Him, or they cannot be saved; and they
      must come according to the words which shall be established by the mouth of the Lamb; and the
      words of the Lamb shall be made known in the records of thy seed, as well as in the records of
      the twelve apostles of the Lamb; wherefore, they shall be established in one, for there is one
      God and one Shepherd over all the earth; and the time cometh that he shall manifest himself
      unto all nations, both unto the Jews, and also unto the Gentiles; and after that he hath
      manifested himself unto the Jews, and also unto the Gentiles, then he shall manifest himself
      unto the Gentiles, and also unto the Jews, and the last shall be first, and the first shall be
      last. </text>

    <text> And it shall come to pass, that if the Gentiles shall hearken unto the Lamb of God in
      that day that he shall manifest himself unto them in word, and also in power, in very deed,
      unto the taking away of their stumbling blocks, if it so be that they harden not their hearts
      against the Lamb; and if it so be that they harden not their hearts against the Lamb of God,
      they shall be numbered among the seed of thy father; yea, they shall be numbered among the
      House of Israel; and they shall be a blest people upon the promised land forever; they shall
      be no more brought down into captivity; and the House of Israel shall no more be confounded;
      and that great pit which hath been digged for them, by that great and abominable church, which
      was founded by the Devil and his children, that he might lead away the souls of men down to
      Hell; yea, the great pit which hath been digged for the destruction of men, shall be filled by
      those who digged it, unto their utter destruction, saith the Lamb of God; not the destruction
      of the soul, save it be the casting of it into that Hell which hath no end; for behold, this
      is according to the captivity of the Devil, and also according to the justice of God, upon all
      those who will work wickedness and abomination before him. And it came to pass that the angel
      spake unto me, Nephi, saying: Thou hast beheld that if the Gentiles repent, it shall be well
      with them; and thou also knowest concerning the covenants of the Lord unto the House of
      Israel; and thou also hast heard, that whoso repenteth not, must perish; therefore, wo be unto
      the Gentiles, if it so be that they harden their hearts against the Lamb of God: for the time
      cometh, saith the Lamb of God, that I will work a great and a marvellous work among the
      children of men; a work which shall be everlasting, either on the one hand or on the other;
      either to the convincing of them unto peace and life eternal, or unto the deliverance of them
      to the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds, unto their being brought
      down into captivity, and also unto destruction, both temporally and spiritually, according to
      the captivity of the Devil, of which I have spoken. And it came to pass that when the angel
      had spoken these words, he saith unto me, Remember thou the covenants of the Father unto the
      House of Israel? I saith unto ,him, yea. And it came to pass that he saith unto me, Look, and
      beheld that great and abominable church, which is the mother of abominations, whose foundation
      is the devil. And he saith unto me, Behold, there is, save it be, two churches: the one is the
      church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the church of the Devil; wherefore. whoso
      belongeth not to the church of the Lamb of God, belongeth to that great church, which is the
      mother of abominations; and she is the whore of all the earth. And it came to pass that I
      looked and beheld the whore of all the earth, and she sat upon many waters; and she had
      dominion over all the earth, among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people. And it came to
      pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of God, and its numbers were few, because of the
      wickedness and abominations of the whore which sat upon many waters; nevertheless, I beheld
      that the church of the Lamb, which were the Saints of God, were also upon all the face of the
      earth; and their dominion upon the face of the earth was small, because of the wickedness of
      the great whore which I saw. And it came to pass that I beheld that the great mother of
      abominations did gather together multitudes upon the face of the earth, among all the nations
      of the Gentiles, to fight against the Lamb of God. And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld
      the power of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of the Lamb, and
      upon the covenant people of the Lord, which were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and
      they were warned with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory. And it came to
      pass that I beheld that the wrath of God was poured out upon the great and abominable church,
      insomuch that there were wars and rumors of wars among all the nations and kindreds of the
      earth; and as there began to be wars and rumors of war among all the nations which belongeth
      to the mother of abominations, the angel spake unto me saying: Behold, the wrath of God is
      upon the mother of harlots; and behold, thou seest all these things! And when the day cometh
      that the wrath of God is poured out upon the mother of harlots, which is the great and
      abominable church of all the earth, whose founder is the Devil, then, at that day, the work of
      the Father shall commence, in preparing the way for the fulfilling of his covenants, which he
      hath made to his people, which are of the House of Israel. And it came to pass that the angel
      spake unto me, saying, Look! And I looked and beheld a man, and he was dressed in a white
      robe; and the angel said unto me, Behold one of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb! Behold, he
      shall see and write the remainder of these things; yea, and also many things which have been;
      and he shall also write concerning the end of the world; wherefore, the things which he shall
      write, are just and true; and, behold, they are written in the book which thou beheld
      proceeding out of the mouth of the Jew; and at the time proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew,
      or, at the time the book proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew, the things which were written,
      were plain and pure, and most precious, and easy to the understanding of all men. And, behold,
      the things which the Apostle of the Lamb shall write, are many things which thou hast seen;
      and, behold, the remainder shalt thou see; but the things which thou shalt see hereafter, thou
      shalt not write; for the Lord God hath ordained the Apostle of the Lamb of God, that he should
      write them. And also, others which have been to them, hath he shown all things, and they have
      written them; and they are sealed up, to come forth in their purity, according to the truth
      which is in the Lamb, in the own due time of the Lord, unto the House of Israel. And I, Nephi,
      heard and bear record, that the name of the Apostle of the Lamb was John, according to the
      word of the angel. And, behold, I, Nephi, am forbidden that I should write the remainder of
      the things which I saw and heard; wherefore, the things which I have written, sufficeth me;
      and I have not written but a small part of the things which I saw. And I bear record, that I
      saw the things which my father saw, and the angel of the Lord did make them known unto me.
      --And now I make an end of speaking concerning the things which I saw, while I was carried
      away in the spirit; and if all the things which I saw are not written, the things which I have
      written are true. And thus it is. Amen. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been carried away in the spirit, and seen
      all these things, I returned to the ten of my father. And it came to pass that I beheld my
      brethren, and they were disputing one with another, concerning the things which my father had
      spoken unto them; for he truly spake many great things unto them, which was hard to be
      understood, save a man should inquire of the Lord; and they being hard in their hearts,
      therefore they did not look unto the Lord as they had ought. And now I, Nephi, was grieved
      because of the hardness of their hearts, and also, because of the things which I had seen, and
      knew they must unavoidably come to pass, because of the great wickedness of the children of
      men. And it came to pass that I was overcome because of my afflictions, for I considered that
      mine afflictions were great above all, because of the destruction of my people; for I had
      beheld their fall. And it came to pass that after I had received strength, I spake unto my
      brethren, desiring to know of them the cause of their disputations. And they said, Behold, we
      cannot understand the words which our father hath spoken concerning the natural branches of
      the olive tree, and also, concerning the Gentiles. And I said unto them, Have ye inquired of
      the Lord? And they said unto me, we have not; for the Lord maketh no such things known unto
      us. Behold, I said unto them, How is it ye do not keep the commandments of the Lord? How is it
      that ye will perish, because of the hardness of your hearts? Do ye not remember the things
      which the Lord hath said: If ye will not harden your hearts, and ask me in faith, believing
      that ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping my commandments, surely, these things shall
      be made known unto you? Behold, I say unto you, that the House of Israel was compared unto an
      olive tree, by the spirit of the Lord which was in our fathers; and, behold, are we not broken
      off from the House of Israel; and are we not a branch of the House of Israel? And now, the
      thing which our father meaneth concerning the grafting in of the natural branches through the
      fulness of the Gentiles, is, that in the latter days, when our seed shall have dwindled in
      unbelief, yea, for the space of many years, and many generations, after that the Messiah hath
      manifested himself in body unto the children of men, then shall the fullness of the Gospel of
      the Messiah come unto the Gentiles, and from the Gentiles unto the remnant of our seed; and at
      that day, shall the remnant of our seed know that they are of the House of Israel, and that
      they are the covenant people of the Lord; and then shall they know and come to the knowledge
      of their forefathers, and also to the knowledge of the Gospel of their Redeemer, which was
      ministered unto their fathers by him; wherefore, they shall come to the knowledge of their
      Redeemer, and the very points of his doctrine, that they may know how to come unto him and be
      saved. And then at that day, will they not rejoice and give praise unto their everlasting God,
      their rock and their salvation? Yea, at that day, will they not receive the strength and
      nourishment from the true vine? Yea, will they not come unto the true fold of God? Behold, I
      say unto you, Yea, they shall be remembered again among the House of Israel; they shall be
      grafted in, being a natural branch of the olive tree, into the true olive tree; and this is
      what our father meaneth; and he meaneth that it will not come to pass, until after that they
      are scattered by the Gentiles; and he meaneth that it shall come by way of the Gentiles, that
      the Lord may shew his power unto the Gentiles, for the very cause that he shall be rejected of
      the Jews, or of the House of Israel; wherefore, our father hath not spoken of our seed alone,
      but also of all the House of Israel, pointing to the covenant which should be fulfilled in the
      latter days; which covenant the Lord made to our father Abraham, saying: In they seed shall
      all the kindreds of the earth be blessed. And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake much unto
      them concerning these things; yea, I spake unto them concerning the restoration of the Jews,
      in the latter days; and I did rehearse unto them the words of Isaiah, which spake concerning
      the restoration of the Jews, or of the House of Israel; and after that they were restored,
      they should no more be confounded, neither should they be scattered again. And it came to pass
      that I did speak many words unto my brethren, that they were pacified, and did humble
      themselves before the Lord. And it came to pass that they did speak unto me again, saying:
      What meaneth the thing which our father saw in a dream? What meaneth the tree which he saw?
      And I said unto them, it was a representation of the tree of life. And they said unto me, What
      meaneth the rod of iron which our father saw, that led to the tree? And I said unto them, that
      it was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto
      it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the firy darts of the
      adversary, overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction. Wherefore I,
      Nephi, did exhort them to give heed unto the word of the Lord; yea, I did exhort them with all
      the energies of my soul, and with all the faculty which I possessed that they would give heed
      to the word of God, and remember to keep his commandments always, in all things. --And they
      said unto me, What meaneth the river of water which our father saw? And I said unto them, that
      the water which my father saw, was filthiness; and so much was his mind swallowed up in other
      things, that he beheld not the filthiness of the water; and I said unto them, that it was an
      awful gulf, which separateth the wicked from the tree of life, and also from the Saints of
      God; and I said unto them, that it was a representation of that awful Hell, which the angel
      said unto me was prepared for the wicked. And I said unto them, that our father also saw, that
      the justice of God did also divide the wicked from the righteous; and the brightness thereof
      was like unto the brightness of a flaming fire, which ascendeth up unto God forever and ever,
      and hath no end. And they said unto me, Doth this thing mean the torment of the body in the
      days of probation, or doth it mean the final state of the soul after the death of the temporal
      body? or doth it speak of the things which are temporal? And it came to pass that I said unto
      them, That it was a representation of things both temporal and spiritual; for the day should
      come that they must be judged of their works, yea, even the works which were done by the
      temporal body in their days of probation; wherefore, if they should die in their wickedness,
      they must be cast off; also as to the things which are spiritual, which are pertaining to
      righteousness; wherefore, they must be brought to stand before God to be judged of their
      works; and if their works have been filthiness, they must needs be filthy; and if they be
      filthy, it must needs be that they cannot dwell in the kingdom of God; if so, The kingdom of
      God must be filthy also. But behold, I say unto you, The kingdom of God is not filthy, and
      there cannot any unclean thing enter into the kingdom of God; wherefore, there must needs be a
      place of filthiness prepared for that which is filthy. And there is a place prepared, yea,
      even that awful Hell of which I have spoken, and the Devil is the preparator of it; wherefore,
      the final state of the souls of men is to dwell in the kingdom of God, or to be cast out
      because of that justice of which I have spoken; wherefore, the wicked are rejected from the
      righteous, and also from that tree of life, whose fruit is most precious and most desirable
      above all other fruits; yea, and it is the greatest of all the gifts of God. And thus I spake
      unto my brethren. --Amen. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end of speaking to my brethren,
      behold, they said unto me, Thou hast declared unto us hard things, more than that which we are
      able to bear. And it came to pass that I said unto them, That I knew that I had spoken hard
      things against the wicked, according to the truth; and the righteous have I justified, and
      testified that they should be lifted up at the last day; wherefore, the guilty taketh the
      truth to be hard, for it cutteth them to the very centre. And now, my brethren, if ye were
      righteous, and were willing to hearken to the truth, and give heed unto it, that ye might walk
      uprightly before God, then ye would not murmur because of the truth, and say thou speaketh
      hard things against us. And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did exhort my brethren, with all
      diligence, to keep the commandments of the Lord. And it came to pass that they did humble
      themselves before the Lord; insomuch, that I had joy and great hopes for them, that they would
      walk in the paths of righteousness. Now all these things were said and done, as my father
      dwelt in a tent in the valley which he called Lemuel. And it came to pass that I, Nephi, took
      one of the daughters of Ishmael to wife; and also my brethren took of the daughters of Ishmael
      to wife; and also, Zoram took the eldest daghter of Ishmael to wife. And thus my father had
      fulfilled all the commandments of the Lord, which had been given unto him. And also, I Nephi,
      had been blessed of the Lord, exceedingly. And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord
      spake unto my father, by night, and commanded him, that on the morrow, he should take his
      journey into the wilderness. And it came to pass that as my father arose in the morning, and
      went forth to the tent door, to his great astonishment, he beheld upon the ground a round
      ball, of curious workmanship; and it was of fine brass. And within the ball were two spindles;
      and the one pointed the way whither we should go into the wilderness. And it came to pass that
      we did gather together whatsoever things we should carry into the wilderness, and all the
      remainder of our provisions which the Lord had given unto us; and we did take seed of every
      kind, that we might carry into the wilderness. And it came to pass that we did take our tents,
      and depart into the wilderness, across the river Laman. And it came to pass that we travelled
      for the space of four days, nearly a south, southeast direction, and we did pitch our tents
      again; and we did call the name of the place Shazer. And it came to pass that we did take our
      bows and our arrows, and go forth into the wilderness, to slay food for our families; and
      after that we had slain food for our families, we did return again to our families in the
      wilderness, to the place of Shazer. And we did go forth again in the wilderness, following the
      same direction, keeping in the most fertile parts of the wilderness, which was in the borders
      near the Red Sea, And it came to pass that we did travel for the space of many days, slaying
      food by the way, with our bows and arrows, and our stones, and our slings; and we did follow
      the directions of the ball, which led us in more fertile parts of the wilderness. And after
      that we had travelled for the space of many days, we did pitch our tents, for the space of a
      time, that we might again rest ourselves and obtain food for our families. And it came to pass
      that as I, Nephi, went forth to slay food, behold, I did break my bow, which was made of fine
      steel; and after that I did break my bow, behold, my brethren were angry with me, because of
      the loss of my bow, for we did obtain no food. And it came to pass that we did return without
      food to our families. And being much fatigued, because of their journeying, they did suffer
      much for want of food. And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, did
      begin to murmur exceedingly, because of their sufferings and afflictions in the wilderness;
      and also, my father began to murmur against the Lord his God; yea, and they were all exceeding
      sorrowful, even that they did murmur against the Lord. Now it came to pass that I, Nephi,
      having been afflicted with my brethren, because of the loss of my bow; and their bows having
      lost their springs, it began to be exceeding difficult, yea, insomuch, that we could obtain no
      food. And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did speak much unto my brethren, because that they
      had hardened their hearts again, even unto complaining against the Lord their God. And it came
      to pass that I, Nephi, did make out of wood a bow, and out of a straight stick, an arrow;
      wherefore, I did arm myself with a bow and arrow, with a sling, and with stones. And I said
      unto my father, Whither shall I go, to obtain food? And it came to pass that he did inquire of
      the Lord, for they had humbled themselves because of my word; for I did say many things unto
      them in the energy of my soul. And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my
      father; and he was truly chastened because of his murmuring against the Lord; insomuch, that
      he was brought down into the depths of sorrow. And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord
      said unto him, Look on the ball, and behold the things which are written! And it came to pass
      that when my father beheld the things which were written upon the ball, he did fear and
      tremble exceedingly; and also my brethren, and the sons of Ishmael, and our wives. And it came
      to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the pointers which were in the ball, that they did work
      according to the faith, and diligence, and heed, which we did give unto them. And there was
      also written upon them, a new writing, which was plain to read, which did give us
      understanding concerning the ways of the Lord; and it was written and changed from time to
      time, according to the faith and diligence which we gave unto it: And thus we see, that by
      small means, the Lord can bring about great things. And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did go
      forth up into the top of the mountain, according to the directions which were given upon the
      ball. And it came to pass that I did slay beasts, insomuch, that I did obtain food for our
      families. --And it came to pass that I did return to our tents, bearing the beasts which I had
      slain; and now, when they beheld that I had obtained food, how great was their joy. And it
      came to pass that they did humble themselves before the Lord, and did give thanks unto him.
      And it came to pass that we did again take our journey, travelling nearly the same course as
      in the beginning; and after that we had travelled for the space of many days, we did pitch our
      tents again, that we might tarry for the space of a time. And it came to pass that Ishmael
      died, and was buried in the place which was called Nahom. And it came to pass that the
      daughters of Ishmael did mourn exceedingly, because of the loss of their father, and because
      of their afflictions in the wilderness; and they did murmur against my father, because he had
      brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, saying: Our father is dead; yea, and we have
      wandered much in the wilderness, and we have suffered much afflictions, hunger, thirst, and
      fatigue; and after all these sufferings, we must perish in the wilderness with hunger. And
      thus they did murmur against my father, and also against me; and they were desirous to return
      again to Jerusalem. And Laman saith unto Lemuel, and also unto the sons of Ishmael, Behold,
      let us slay our father, and also our brother Nephi, who hath taken it upon him to be our ruler
      and our teacher, who are his elder brethren. Now, he saith that the Lord hath talked with him,
      and also, that angels hath ministered unto him! But behold, we know that he lieth unto us; and
      he telleth us these things, and he worketh many things by his cunning arts, that he may
      deceive our eyes, thinking, that he may lead us away into some strange wilderness; and after
      that he hath led us away, he hath thought to make himself a King and a ruler over us, that he
      may do with us according to his will and pleasure. And after this manner, did my brother Laman
      stir up their hearts to anger. And it came to pass that the Lord was with us; yea, even the
      voice of the Lord came and did speak many words unto them, and did chasten them exceedingly;
      and after that they were chastened by the voice of the Lord, they did turn away their anger,
      and did repent of their sins, insomuch, that the Lord did bless us again with food, that we
      did not perish. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that we did again take our journey in the wilderness; and we did
      travel nearly eastward, from that time forth. And we did travel and wade through much
      affliction in the wilderness; and our women did bear children in the wilderness. And so great
      were the blessings of the Lord upon us, that while we did live upon the raw meat in the
      wilderness, our women did give plenty of suck for their children, and were strong, yea, even
      like unto the men; and they began to bear the journeyings without murmurings. And thus we see
      that the commandments of God must be fulfilled. And if it so be that the children of men keep
      the commandments of God, he doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby
      they can accomplish the thing which he hath commanded them; wherefore, he did provide means
      for us while we did sojourn in the wilderness. And we did sojourn for the space of many years,
      yea, even eight years in the wilderness. And we did come to the land which we called
      Bountiful, because of its much fruit, and also, wild honey; and all these things were prepared
      of the Lord, that we might not perish. --And we beheld the Sea, which we called Irreantum,
      which being interpreted, is, many waters. And it came to pass that we did pitch our tents by
      the seashore; and notwithstanding we had suffered many afflictions and much difficulty, yea,
      even so much that we cannot write them all, we were exceedingly rejoiced when we came to the
      seashore; and we called the place Bountiful, because of its much fruit. And it came to pass
      that after I, Nephi, had been in the land of Bountiful for the space of many days, the voice
      of the Lord came unto me, saying: Arise, and get thee into the mountains. And it came to pass
      that I arose and went up into the mountain, and cried unto the Lord. And it came to pass that
      the Lord spake unto me, saying: Thou shalt construct a ship, after the manner which I shall
      shew thee, that I may carry thy people across these waters. And I saith, Lord, whither shall I
      go. that I may find ore to molten, that I may make tools to construct the ship, after the
      manner which thou hast shewn unto me? And it came to pass that the Lord told me whither I
      should go to find ore, that I might make tools. And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make
      bellowses wherewith to blow the fire, of the skins of beasts; and after that I had made
      bellowses, that I might have wherewith to blow the fire, I did smite two stones together, that
      I might make fire; for the Lord had not hitherto suffered that we should make much fire, as we
      journied in the wilderness; for he saith, I will make that thy food shall become sweet, that
      ye cook it not; and I will also be your light in the wilderness; and I will prepare the way
      before you, if it so be that ye shall keep my commandments; wherefore, inasmuch as ye shall
      keep my commandments, ye shall be led towards the promised land; and ye shall know that it is
      by me that ye are led. Yea, and the Lord said also, that after ye have arrived to the promised
      land, ye shall know that I the Lord, am God; and that I, the Lord, did deliver you from
      destruction; yea, that I did bring you out of the land of Jerusalem; wherefore, I, Nephi, did
      strive to keep the commandments of the Lord, and I did exhort my brethren to faithfulness and
      diligence. And it came to pass that I did make the tools of the ore which I did molten out of
      rock. And when my brethren saw that I was about to build a ship, they began to murmur against
      me, saying: Our brother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a ship; yea, and he also
      thinketh that he can cross these great waters. And thus my brethren did complain against me,
      and were desirous that they might not labor, for they did not believe that I could build a
      ship; neither would they believe that I was instructed of the Lord. And now it came to pass
      that I, Nephi, was exceeding sorrowful, because of the hardness of their hearts; and now when
      they saw that I began to be sorrowful, they were glad in their hearts, insomuch, that they did
      rejoice over me, saying: We knew that ye could not construct a ship, for we knew that ye were
      lacking in judgment; wherefore, thou canst not accomplish so great a work; and thou art like
      unto our father, led away by the foolish imaginations of his heart; yea, he hath led us out of
      the land of Jerusalem; and we have wandered, in the wilderness for these many years; and our
      women have toiled, being big with child; and they have borne children in the wilderness, and
      suffered all things, save it were death; and it would have been better that they had died,
      before they came out of Jerusalem, than to have suffered these afflictions. Behold, these many
      years we have suffered in the wilderness, which time we might have enjoyed our possessions,
      and the land of our inheritance; yea, and we might have been happy; and we know that the
      people which were in the land of Jerusalem, were a righteous people; for they kept the statues
      and the judgments of the Lord, and all his commandments, according to the law of Moses;
      wherefore, we know that they are a righteous people; and our father hath judged them, and hath
      led us away because we would hearken unto his words; yea, and our brother is like unto him.
      And after this manner of language did my brethren murmur and complain against us. And it came
      to pass that I, Nephi, spake unto them, saying: Do ye believe that our fathers, which were the
      children of Israel, would have been led away out of the hands of the Egyptians, if they had
      not hearkened unto the words of the Lord? Yea, do ye suppose that they would have been led out
      of bondage, if the Lord had not commanded Moses that he should lead them out of bondage? Now
      ye know that the children of Israel were in bondage; and ye know that they were laden with
      tasks, which were grievous to be borne; wherefore, ye know that it must needs be a good thing
      for them, that they should be brought out of bondage. Now ye know that Moses was commanded of
      the Lord to do that great work; and ye know that by his word, the waters of the Red Sea were
      divided hither and thither, and they passed through on dry ground. But ye know that the
      Egyptians were drowned in the Red Sea, which were the armies of Pharaoh; and ye also know that
      they were fed with manna, in the wilderness; yea, and ye also know that Moses by his word,
      according to the power of God which was in him, smote the rock, and there came forth water,
      that the children of Israel might quench their thirst; and notwithstanding they being led, the
      Lord their God, their Redeemer, going before them, leading them by day, and giving light unto
      them by night, and doing all things for them which was expedient for man to receive, they
      hardened their hearts, and blinded their minds, and prevailed against Moses and against the
      true and living God. And it came to pass that according to his word, he did destroy them; and
      according to his word, he did lead them; and according to his word, he did do all things for
      them; and there was not anything done, save it were by his word. And after they had crossed
      the river Jordan, he did make them mighty, unto the driving out the children of the land, yea,
      unto the scattering them to destruction. And now do ye suppose that the children of this land,
      which were in the land of promise, which were driven out by our fathers, do ye suppose that
      they were righteous? Behold, I say unto you, nay. Do ye suppose that our fathers would have
      been more choice than they, if they had been righteous? I say unto you, nay, behold the Lord
      esteemeth all flesh in one: He that is righteous, is favored of God. But, behold, this people
      had rejected every word of God, and the were ripe in iniquity; and the fulness of the wrath of
      God was upon them; and the Lord did curse them; and the Lord did curse the land against them,
      and bless it unto our fathers; yea, he did curse it against them unto their destruction; and
      he did bless it unto our fathers, unto obtaining power over it. Behold, the Lord hath created
      the earth, that it should be inhabited; and he hath created his children, that they should
      possess it. And he raiseth up a righteous nation, and destroyeth the nations of the wicked.
      And he leadeth away the righteous into precious lands, and the wicked he destroyeth, and
      curseth the land unto them for their sakes. He ruleth high in the Heavens, for it is his
      throne, and the earth is his footstool. And he loveth them which will have him to be their
      God. Behold, he loveth our fathers; and he covenanted with them, yea, even Abraham, Isaac, and
      Jacob; and he remembered the covenants which he had made; wherefore, he did bring them out of
      the land of Egypt, and he did straighten them in the wilderness with his rod, for they
      hardened their hearts, even as ye have; and the Lord straightened them, because of their
      iniquity. He sent firy-flying serpents among them; and after they were bitten, he prepared a
      way, that they might be healed; and the labor which they had to perform, was to look! and
      because of the simpleness of the way, or the easiness of it, there were many which perished.
      And they did harden their hearts from time to time, and they did revile against Moses, and
      also against God; nevertheless, ye know that they were led forth by his matchless power, into
      the land of promise. --And now, after all these things, the time has come that they have
      become wicked, yea, nearly unto ripeness; and I know not but they are at this day about to be
      destroyed, for I know that the day must surely come, that they must be destroyed, save a few
      only, which shall be led away into captivity. wherefore, the Lord commanded my father that he
      should depart into the wilderness; and the Jews also sought to take away his life; yea, and ye
      also have sought to take away his life; wherefore, ye are murderers in your hearts, and ye are
      like unto they: Ye are swift to do iniquity, but slow to remember the Lord your God. Ye have
      seen the angel, and he spake unto you; yea, ye have heard his voice from time to time; and he
      hath spoken unto you in a still, small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye could not feel
      his words; wherefore, he hath spoken unto you like unto the voice of thunder, which did cause
      the earth to shake as if it were to divide asunder. And ye also know, that by the power of his
      almighty word, he can cause the earth that it shall pass away; yea, and ye know that by his
      word, he can cause the rough places be made smooth, and smooth places shall be broken up. O,
      then, why is it, that ye can be so hard in your hearts? Behold, my soul is rent with anguish
      because of you, and my heart is pained: I fear lest ye shall be cast off forever. Behold, I am
      full of the spirit of God, insomuch as if my frame had no strength. And now it came to pass
      that when I had spoken these words, they were angry with me, and were desirous to throw me
      into the depths of the Sea; and as they came forth to lay their hands upon me, I spake unto
      them saying: In the name of the Almighty God, I command you that ye touch me not, for I am
      filled with the power of God, even unto the consuming of my flesh; and whoso shall lay their
      hands upon me, shall wither even as a dried reed; and he shall be as nought before the power
      of God, for God shall smite him. And it came to pass that I, Nephi, saith unto them, That they
      should murmur no more against their father; neither should they withhold their labor from me,
      for God had commanded me that I should build a ship. And I saith unto them, If God had
      commanded me to do all things, I could do it. If he should command me that I should say unto
      this water, Be thou earth; and if I should say it, it would be done. And now, if the Lord hath
      such great power, and hath wrought so many miracles among the children of men, how is it that
      he cannot instruct me, that I should build a ship? And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said
      many things unto my brethren, insomuch that they were confounded, and could not contend
      against me; neither durst they lay their hands upon me, nor touch me with their fingers, even
      for the space of many days. Now they durst not do this, lest they should wither before me, so
      powerful was the spirit of God; and thus it had wrought upon them. And it came to pass that
      the Lord said unto me, Stretch forth thine hand again unto thy brethren, and they shall not
      wither before thee, but I will shock them, saith the Lord; and this will I do, that they may
      know that I am the Lord their God. And it came to pass that I stretched forth my hand unto my
      brethren, and they did not wither before me; but the Lord did shake them, even according to
      the word which he had spoken. And now, they said, We know of a surety, that the Lord is with
      thee, for we know that it is the power of the Lord that hath shaken us. And they fell down
      before me, and were about to worship me, but I would not suffer them, saying: I am thy
      brother, yea, even thy younger brother; wherefore, worship the Lord thy God, and honor thy
      father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God shall give
      thee. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that they did worship the Lord, and did go forth with me; and we did
      work timbers of curious workmanship. And the Lord did shew me from time to time, after what
      manner I should work the timbers of the ship. Now I, Nephi, did not work the timbers after the
      manner which was learned by men, neither did I build the ship after the manner of men; but I
      did build it after the manner which the Lord had shewn unto me; wherefore, it was not after
      the manner of men. And I, Nephi, did go into the mount oft, and I did pray oft unto the Lord;
      wherefore, the Lord shewed unto me great things. And it came to pass that after I had finished
      the ship according to the word of the Lord, my brethren beheld that it was good, and that the
      workmanship thereof was exceeding fine; wherefore, they did humble themselves again before the
      Lord. And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my father, that we should arise
      and go down into the ship. --And it came to pass that on the morrow, after that we had
      prepared all things, much fruits and meat from the wilderness, and honey in abundance, and
      provisions, according to that which the Lord had commanded us, we did go down into the ship
      with all our loading and our seeds, and whatsoever thing we had brought with us, every one
      according to his age; wherefore, we did all go down into the ship, with our wives and our
      children. And now, my father had begat two sons, in the wilderness: The eldest was called
      Jacob, and the younger, Joseph. And it came to pass that after we had all gone down into the
      ship, and had taken with us our provisions and things which had been commanded us, we did put
      forth into the sea, and were driven forth before the wind, towards the promised land; and
      after that we had been driven forth before the wind, for the space of many days, behold, my
      brethren, and the sons of Ishmael, and also their wives, began to make themselves merry,
      insomuch that they began to dance, and to sing, and to speak with much rudeness, yea, even to
      that they did forget by what power they had been brought thither; yea, they were lifted up
      unto exceeding rudeness. And I, Nephi, began to fear exceedingly, lest the Lord should be
      angry with us, and smite us, because of our iniquity, that we should be swallowed up in the
      depths of the Sea; wherefore, I, Nephi, began to speak to them with much soberness; but,
      behold they were angry with me, saying: We will not that our younger brother shall be a ruler
      over us. And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel did take me and bind me with cords, and
      they did treat me with much harshness; nevertheless, the Lord did suffer it, that he might
      shew forth his power, unto the fulfilling of his word which he hath spoken, concerning the
      wicked. And it came to pass that after they had bound me, insomuch that I could not move, the
      compass, which had been prepared of the Lord, did cease to work; wherefore, they knew not
      whither they should steer the ship, insomuch, that there arose a great storm, yea, a great and
      terrible tempest; and we were driven back upon the waters for the space of three days; and
      they began to be frightened exceedingly, lest they should be drowned in the Sea; nevertheless,
      they did loose me not. --And on the fourth day which we had been driven back, the tempest
      began to be exceeding sore. And it came to pass that we were about to be swallowed up in the
      depths of the Sea. And after that we had been driven back upon the waters for the space of
      four days, my brethren began to see that the judgment of God was upon them, and that they must
      perish, save that they should repent of their iniquities; wherefore, they came unto me and
      loosed the bands which was upon my wrists, and behold, they had much swollen, exceedingly; and
      also, mine ancles were much swollen, and great was the soreness thereof. Nevertheless, I did
      look unto my God, and I did praise him all the day long; and I did not murmur against the
      Lord, because of mine afflictions. Now, my father, Lehi, had said many things unto them, and
      also unto the sons of Ishmael; but, behold, they did breathe out much threatnings against any
      one that should speak for me; and my parents being stricken in years, and having suffered much
      grief because of their children, they were brought down, yea, even unto their sick beds.
      Because of their grief, and much sorrow, and the iniquity of my brethren, they were brought
      near even to be carried out of this time, to meet their God; yea, their gray hairs were about
      to be brought down to lie low in the dust; Yea, even they were near to be cast into a watery
      grave. And Jacob and Joseph also, being young, having need of much nourishment, were grieved
      because of the afflictions of their mother; and also my wife, with her tears and prayers, and
      also my children, did not soften the hearts of my brethren, that they would loose me; and
      there was nothing, save it were the power of God, which threatened them with destruction,
      could soften their hearts; wherefore, when they saw that they were about to be swallowed up in
      the depths of the sea, they repented to the thing which they had done, insomuch that they
      loosed me. And it came to pass that after they had loosed me, behold, I took the compass, and
      it did work whither I desired it. And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord; and after
      that I had prayed, the winds did cease, and the storm did cease, and there was a great calm.
      And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did guide the ship, that we sailed again toward the
      promised land. And it came to pass that after we had sailed for the space of many days, we did
      arrive to the promised land; and we went forth upon the land, and did pitch our tents; and we
      did call it the promised land. And it came to pass that we did begin to till the earth, and we
      began to plant seeds; yea, we did put all our seeds into the earth, which we had brought from
      the land of Jerusalem. And it came to pass that they did grow exceedingly; wherefore, we were
      blessed in abundance. And it came to pass that we did find upon the Land of Promise, as we
      journied in the wilderness, that there were beasts in the forests of every kind, both the cow,
      and the ox, and the ass, and the horse, and the goat, and the wild goat, and all manner of
      wild animals, which were used for the use of men. And we did find all manner of ore, both of
      gold, and of silver, and of copper. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that the Lord commanded me, wherefore I did make plates of ore, that
      I might engraven upon them the record of my people. And upon the plates which I made, I did
      engraven the record of my father, and also our journeyings in the wilderness, and the
      prophecies of my father; and also, many of mine own prophecies have I engraven upon them. And
      I knew not at that time when I made them, that I should be commanded of the Lord to make these
      plates; wherefore, the record of my father, and the genealogy of his fathers, and the more
      part of all our proceedings in the wilderness, are engraven upon those plates of which I have
      spoken; wherefore, the things which transpired before that I made these plates, are of a
      truth, more particularly made mention upon the first plates. And after that I made these
      plates by way of commandment, I, Nephi, received a commandment, that the ministry, and the
      prophecies, the more plain and precious parts of them, should be written upon these plates;
      and that the things which were written, should be kept for the instruction of my people, which
      should possess the land, and also for other wise purposes, which purposes, are known unto the
      Lord; wherefore, I, Nephi, did make a record upon the other plates, which gives an account, or
      which gives a greater account, of the wars, and contentions, and destructions of my people.
      And this I have done, and commanded my people that they should do, after that I was gone, and
      that these plates should be handed down from one generation to another, or from one prophet to
      another, until further commandments of the Lord. And an account of my making these plates
      shall be given hereafter; and then behold, I proceed according to that which I have spoken;
      and this I do, that the more sacred things may be kept for the knowledge of my people.
      Nevertheless, I do not write any thing upon the plates, save it be that I think it be sacred.
      And now, if I do err, even did they err of old. Not that I would excuse myself because of
      other men, but because of the weakness which is in me, according to the flesh, I would excuse
      myself. For the things which some men esteem to be of great worth, both to the body and soul,
      others set at nought, and trample under their feet. Yea, even the very God of Israel, do men
      trample under their feet; I say, trample under their feet; but I would speak in other words:
      They do set him at nought, and hearken not to the voice of his counsels; and behold, he cometh
      according to the words of the angel, in six hundred years from the time my father left
      Jerusalem: And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of nought;
      wherefore, they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it.
      Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving kindness and his long
      suffering towards the children of men. And the God of our fathers, which were led out of
      Egypt, out of bondage, and also were preserved in the wilderness by him; yea, the God of
      Abraham, and of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, yieldeth himself according to the words of the
      angel, as a man, into the hands of wicked men, to be lifted up according to the words of
      Zenock, and to be crucified, according to the words of Neum, and to be buried in a sepulchre,
      and according to the words of Zenos, which he spake, concerning the three days of darkness,
      which should be a sign given of his death, unto them who should inhabit the isles of the sea;
      more especially given unto them which are of the House of Israel. For thus spake the Prophet:
      The Lord God surely shall visit the House of Israel at that day: some with his voice, because
      of their righteousness, unto their great joy and salvation; and others with the thunderings
      and lightnings of his power, by tempest, by fire, and by smoke, and vapour of darkness, and by
      the opening of the earth, and by mountains which shall be carried up; and all these things
      must surely come, saith the Prophet Zenos. And the rocks of the earth must rend; and because
      the groanings of the earth, many of the Kings of the isles of the sea shall be wrought upon by
      the spirit of God, to exclaim, The God of nature suffers. And as for they which are at
      Jerusalem, saith the prophet, shall be scourged by all people, saith the prophet, because they
      crucify the God of Israel, and turned their hearts aside, rejecting signs, and wonders, and
      power and glory of the God of Israel; and because they turned their hearts aside, saith the
      prophet, and have despised the Holy one of Israel, they shall wander in the flesh, and perish,
      and become a hiss and a by-word, and be hated among all nations; nevertheless, when that day
      cometh, saith the prophet, that they no more turn aside their hearts against the Holy one of
      Israel, then will he remember the covenants which he made to their fathers; yea, then will he
      remember the isles of the sea; yea, and all the people which are of the House of Israel, will
      I gather in, saith the Lord, according to the words of the Prophet Zenos, from the four
      quarters of the earth; yea, and all the earth shall see the salvation of the Lord, saith the
      prophet; every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, shall be blessed. And I, Nephi, have
      written these things unto my people, that perhaps I might persuade them that they would
      remember the Lord their Redeemer; wherefore, I speak unto all the House of Israel, if it so be
      that they should obtain these things. For behold, I have workings in the spirit, which doth
      weary me, even that all my joints are weak, for they which are at Jerusalem; for had not the
      Lord been merciful, to shew unto me concerning them, even as he had prophets of old; for he
      surely did shew unto the prophets of old, all things concerning them; and also, he did shew
      unto many, concerning us; wherefore, it must needs be, that we know concerning them, for they
      are written upon the plates of brass. Now it came to pass that I, Nephi, did teach my brethren
      these things. And it came to pass that I did read many things to them, which were engraven
      upon the plates of brass, that they might know concerning the doings of the Lord in other
      lands, among people of old. And I did read many things unto them, which were written in the
      Book of Moses; but that I might more fully persuade them to believe in the Lord their
      Redeemer, wherefore I did read unto them that which was written by the Prophet Isaiah; for I
      did liken all the scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning. Wherefore,
      I spake unto them, saying: Hear ye the words of the prophet, ye which are a remnant of the
      House of Israel, a branch of which have been broken off; hear ye the words of the prophet,
      which was written unto all the House of Israel, and liken it unto yourselves, that ye may have
      hope as well as your brethren, from whom ye have broken off. For after this manner hath the
      prophet written: </text>

    <text> Hearken and hear this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are
      come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention
      of the God of Israel; yet they swear not in truth, nor righteousness.-- Nevertheless, they
      call themselves of the Holy city, but they do not stay themselves upon the God of Israel,
      which is the Lord of hosts; yea, the Lord of hosts is his name. Behold, I have declared the
      former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I
      did shew them suddenly. And I did it because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck was
      an iron sinew, and thy brow brass; and I have, even from the beginning, declared to thee;
      before it came to pass I shewed them thee; and I shewed them for fear lest thou shouldst say,
      Mine idol hath done them; and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them. Thou
      hast seen and heard all this; and will ye not declare them? And that I have shewed thee new
      things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them. They are created now,
      and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not, they were
      declared unto thee, lest thou shouldst say, Behold, I knew them. Yea, and thou heardest not;
      yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time, thine ear was not opened: for I know that thou
      wouldst deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb. Nevertheless,
      for my name sake I will defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain from thee, that I
      cut thee not off. For behold, I have refined thee; I have chosen thee in the furnace of
      affliction. For mine own sake, yea, for mine own sake, will I do this; for I will not suffer
      my name to be polluted, and I will not give my glory unto another. Hearken unto me, O Jacob
      and Israel, my called; for I am he; and I am the first, and I am also the last. Mine hand hath
      also laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: and I
      called unto them, and they stand up together. All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which
      among them hath declared these things unto them? The Lord hath loved him: yea, and he will
      fulfill his word which he hath declared by them; and he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and
      his arm shall come upon the Chaldeans. Also, saith the Lord: I the Lord, yea, I have spoken,
      yea, I have called him, to declare I have brought him; and he shall make his way prosperous.
      Come ye near unto me; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it
      was declared, have I spoken; and the Lord God, and his spirit, hath sent me. And thus saith
      the Lord, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel I have sent him, the Lord thy God, which
      teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way thou shouldst go, hath done it. O that
      thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy
      righteousness as the waves of the sea; thy seed also had been as the sand; the offspring of
      thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from
      before me. Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare
      ye, tell this, utter to the end of the earth; say ye, The Lord hath redeemed his servant
      Jacob. --And they thirsted not; he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow
      out of the rock for them: he cleaved the rock also, and the waters gushed out. And
      notwithstanding he hath done all this, and greater also, There is no peace, saith the Lord,
      unto the wicked. </text>

    <text> And again: Hearken, O ye house of Israel, all ye that are broken off and are driven out,
      because of the wickedness of the pastors of my people; yea, all ye that are broken off, that
      are scattered abroad, which are of my people, O house of Israel. Listen, O isles, unto me; and
      hearken, ye people, from far; The Lord hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my
      mother hath he made mention of my name. And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the
      shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;
      and said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified. Then I said, I
      have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain; surely, my judgment is
      with the Lord, and my work with my God. And now, saith the Lord, that formed me from the womb
      that I should be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet
      shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God shall be my strength. And he said, It
      is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to
      restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou
      mayest be my salvation unto the ends of the earth. --Thus saith the Lord, the Redeemer of
      Israel, his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nations abhorreth, to
      servants of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the Lord
      that is faithful. Thus saith the Lord, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, O isles of the
      sea, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee my
      servant for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate
      heritages: that thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that sit in darkness, Shew
      yourselves. --They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.
      They shall not hunger or thirst, neither shall the heat or the sun smite them: for he that
      hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them. And I
      will make all my mountains away, and my highways shall be exalted. And then, O house of
      Israel, behold, these shall come from far; and lo, these from the north and from the west; and
      these from the land of Sinim. Sing, O Heavens; and be joyful, O earth; for the feet of them
      which are in the east shall be established; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for
      they shall be smitten no more: for the Lord hath comforted his people, and will have mercy
      upon his afflicted. But, behold, Zion hath said, The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath
      forgotten me; but he will shew that he hath not. For can a woman forget her sucking child,
      that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I
      not forget thee, O house of Israel. Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy
      walls are continually before me. Thy children shall make haste against thy destroyers; and
      they that made thee waste, shall go forth of thee. Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold:
      all these gather themselves together, and they shall come to thee. And as I live, saith the
      Lord, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on even
      as a bride. For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even
      now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants; and they that swallowed thee up, shall be far
      away. The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other, shall again in thine
      ears say, The place is too straight for me: give place to me that I may dwell. Then shalt thou
      say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am
      desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was
      left alone; these, where have they been? Thus saith the Lord God. Behold, I will lift up mine
      hand to the Gentiles, and set my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons in
      their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders. And kings shall be thy
      nursing fathers, and thy queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their
      face towards the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the
      Lord: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me. For shall the prey be taken from the
      mighty, or the lawful captives delivered? But thus saith the Lord, Even the captives of the
      mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will
      contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children. And I will feed them
      that oppress thee with their own flesh; they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with
      sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the Lord am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the
      mighty one of Jacob. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, after that I had read these things which
      were engraven upon the plates of brass, my brethren came unto me and said unto me, What
      meaneth these things which ye have read? Behold, are they to be understood according to the
      spirit and not the flesh? And I, Nephi, sayeth unto them, Behold, they were made manifest unto
      the prophet, by the voice of the spirit: for by the spirit are all things made known unto the
      prophet, which shall come upon the children of men, according to the flesh. Wherefore, the
      things which I have read, are things pertaining to things both temporal and spiritual: for it
      appears that the House of Israel, sooner or later, will be scattered upon all the face of the
      earth, and also among all nations, and before there are many which are already lost from the
      knowledge of they which are at Jerusalem. Yea, the more part of all the tribes have been led
      away; and they are scattered to and fro upon the isles of the sea: and wither they are, none
      of us knoweth, save that we know that they have been led away. --And since that they have been
      led away, these things have been prophesied concerning them, and also concerning all they
      which shall hereafter be scattered and be confounded, because of the Holy One of Israel: for
      against him will they harden their hearts: wherefore, they shall be scattered among all
      nations, and shall be hated by all men. Nevertheless, after that they have been nursed by the
      Gentiles, and the Lord hath lifted up his hand upon the Gentiles and set them up for a
      standard, and their children shall be carried in their arms, and their daughters shall be
      carried upon their shoulders, behold, these things of which are spoken, are temporal: for thus
      is the covenants of the Lord with our fathers; and it meaneth us in the days to come, and also
      our brethren which are of the House of Israel. And it meaneth that the time cometh that after
      all the House of Israel have been scattered and confounded, that the Lord God will raise up a
      mighty nation among the Gentiles, yea, even upon the face of this land; and by them shall our
      seed be scattered. And after that our seed is scattered, the Lord God will proceed to do a
      marvellous work among the gentiles, which shall be of great worth unto our seed; wherefore, it
      is likened unto the being nourished by the Gentiles, and being carried in their arms, and upon
      their shoulders. And it shall also be of worth unto the Gentiles; and not only unto the
      Gentiles, but unto all the House of Israel, unto the making known of the covenants of the
      Father of Heaven unto Abraham, saying, In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be
      blessed. And I would, my brethren, that ye should know that all the kindreds of the earth
      cannot be blessed, unless he shall make bare his arm in the eyes of the nations. Wherefore,
      the Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm in the eyes of all the nations, in bringing
      about his covenants and his Gospel, unto they which are of the House of Israel. Wherefore, he
      will bring them again out of captivity, and they shall be gathered together to the lands of
      their inheritance; and they shall be brought out of obscurity, and out of darkness; and they
      shall know that the Lord is their Saviour and their Redeemer, the mighty one of Israel. And
      the blood of that great and abominable church, which is the whore of all the earth, shall turn
      upon their own heads: for they shall war among themselves, and the sword of their own hands
      shall fall upon their own heads, and they shall be drunken with their own blood. And every
      nation which shall war against thee, O house of Israel, shall be turned one against another,
      and they shall fall into the pit which they digged to ensnare the people of the Lord. And all
      that fight against Zion, shall be destroyed. And that great whore, which hath perverted the
      right ways of the Lord; yea, that great and abominable church, shall stumble to the dust, and
      great shall be the fall of it. For behold, saith the prophet, that the times cometh speedily,
      that Satan shall have no more power over the hearts of the children of men: for the day soon
      cometh, that all the proud and they which do wickedly, shall be as stubble; and the day cometh
      that they must be burned. For the time soon cometh, that the fulness of the wrath of God shall
      be poured out upon all the children of men: for he will not suffer that the wicked shall
      destroy the righteous. Wherefore, he will preserve the righteous by his power, even if it so
      be that the fulness of his wrath must come, and the righteous be preserved, even unto the
      destruction of their enemies by fire. Wherefore, the righteous need not fear: for thus saith
      the prophet, They shall be saved, even if it be so as by fire. Behold, my brethren, I say unto
      you, that these things must shortly come; yea, even blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke must
      come; and it must needs be upon the face of this earth; and it cometh unto men according to
      the flesh, if it so be that they will harden their hearts against the Holy One of Israel: for
      behold, the righteous shall not perish; for the time surely must come, that all they which
      fight against Zion, shall be cut off. And the Lord will surely prepare a way for his people,
      unto the fulfilling of the words of Moses, which he spake, saying: A prophet shall the Lord
      your God raise up unto you, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall
      say unto you. And it shall come to pass that all they which will not hear that prophet, shall
      be cut off from among the people. And now I, Nephi, declare unto you, that this prophet of
      whom Moses spake, was the Holy One of Israel; wherefore, he shall execute judgment in
      righteousness; and the righteous need not fear, for it is they which shall not be confounded.
      But it is the kingdom of the Devil, which shall be built up among the children of men, which
      kingdom is established among them which are in the flesh: for the time speedily shall come,
      that all churches which are built up to get gain, and they which are built up to get power
      over the flesh, and they which are built up to become popular in the eyes of the world, and
      they which seek the lusts of the flesh and the things of the world, and do all manner of
      iniquity; yea, in fine, all they which belong to the kingdom of the Devil, it is they which
      need fear, and tremble, and quake; it is they which must be brought low in the dust; it is
      they which must be consumed as stubble: and this is according to the words of the prophet. And
      the time cometh speedily, that the righteous must be led up as calves of the stall, and the
      Holy One of Israel must reign in dominion, and might, and power, and great glory. And he
      gathereth his children from the four quarters of the earth; and he numbereth his sheep, and
      they know him; and there shall be one fold and one shepherd; and he shall feed his sheep, and
      in him they shall find pasture. --And because of the righteousness of his people, Satan, hath
      no power; wherefore, he cannot be loosed for the space of many years: for he hath no power
      over the hearts of the people, for they dwell in righteousness, and the Holy One of Israel
      reigneth. And now behold, I, Nephi, say unto you, that all these things must come, according
      to the flesh. But, behold, all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, shall dwell safely in
      the Holy One of Israel, if it so be that they will repent. And now I, Nephi, make an end; for
      I durst not speak further as yet, concerning these things. Wherefore, my brethren, I would
      that ye consider that the things which have been written upon the plates of brass, are true;
      and they testify that a man must be obedient to the commandments of God. Wherefore, ye need
      not suppose that I and my father are the only ones that have testified, and also taught them.
      Wherefore, if ye shall be obedient to the commandments, and endure to the end, ye shall be
      saved at the last day. And thus it is. Amen. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass after I, Nephi, had made an end of teaching my brethren, our
      father, Lehi, also spake many things unto them: how great things the Lord had done for them,
      in bringing them out of the land of Jerusalem. And he spake unto them concerning their
      rebellions upon the waters, and the mercies of God in sparing their lives, that they were not
      swallowed up in the sea. And he also spake unto them concerning the land of promise, which
      they had obtained: how merciful the Lord had been in warning us that we should flee out of the
      land of Jerusalem. For, Behold, saith he, I have seen a vision, in the which I know that
      Jerusalem is destroyed; and had we remained in Jerusalem, we should also have perished. But,
      said he, notwithstanding our afflictions, we have obtained a land of promise, a land which is
      choice above all other lands; a land which the Lord God hath covenanted with me should be a
      land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me, and to
      my children forever; and also they which should be led out of other countries, by the hand of
      the Lord. Wherefore, I, Lehi, prophesy according to the workings of the spirit which is in me,
      that there shall be none come into this land, save they should be brought by the hand of the
      Lord. Wherefore, this land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring. And if it so be that
      they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given, it shall be a land of
      liberty unto them; wherefore, they shall never be brought down into captivity: if so it shall
      be because of iniquity: for if iniquity shall abound, cursed shall be the land for their
      sakes; but unto the righteous, it shall be blessed forever. And behold, it is wisdom that this
      land should be kept as yet from the knowledge of other nations: for behold, many nations would
      overrun the land, that there would be no place for an inheritance. Wherefore, I, Lehi, have
      obtained a promise that inasmuch as they which the Lord God shall bring out of the land of
      Jerusalem shall keep his commandments, they shall prosper upon the face of this land; and they
      shall be kept from all other nations, that they may possess this land unto themselves. And if
      it so be that they shall keep his commandments, they shall be blessed upon the face of this
      land, and there shall be none to molest them, nor to take away the land of their inheritance;
      and they shall dwell safely forever. But behold, when the time cometh that they shall dwindle
      in unbelief, after that they have received so great blessings from the hand of the Lord;
      having a knowledge of the creation of the earth, and all men knowing the great and marvellous
      works of the Lord from the creation of the world; having power given them to do all things by
      faith; having all the commandments from the beginning, and having been brought by his infinite
      goodness into this precious land of promise; behold, I say, if the day shall come that they
      will reject the Holy One of Israel, the true Messiah their Redeemer and their God, behold, the
      judgments of him that is just, shall rest upon them; yea, he will bring other nations unto
      them and he will give unto them power, and he will take away from them the lands of their
      possessions; and he will cause them to be scattered and smitten. Yea, as one generation
      passeth to another, there shall be bloodsheds and great visitations among them; wherefore, my
      sons, I would that ye would remember; yea, I would that ye would hearken, unto my words. O
      that ye would awake, awake from the deep sleep, yea, even from the sleep of hell, and shake
      off the awful chains by which ye are bound, which are the chains which bind the children of
      men, that they are carried away captive down to the eternal gulf of misery and wo! Awake! and
      arise from the dust, and hear the words of a trembling parent, whose limbs ye must soon lay
      down in the cold and silent grave, from whence no traveller can return: a few more days, and I
      go the way of all the earth. But behold, the Lord hath redeemed my soul from hell: I have
      beheld his glory, and I am encircled about eternally in the arms of his love. And I desire
      that ye should remember to observe the statues and the judgments of the Lord: behold, this
      hath been the anxiety of my soul, from the beginning. My heart hath been weighed down with
      sorrow from time to time: for I have feared, lest for the hardness of your hearts, lest the
      Lord your God should come out in the fulness of his wrath, upon you, that ye be cut off and
      destroyed forever; or, that a cursing should come upon you, for the space of many generations;
      and ye are visited by sword, and by famine, and are hated, and are led according to the will
      and the captivity of the Devil. O my sons, that these things might not come upon you, but that
      ye might be a choice and a favored people of the Lord. But, behold, his will be done: for his
      ways are righteousness forever; and he hath said, that inasmuch as ye shall keep my
      commandments, ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments,
      ye shall be cut off from my presence. And now that my soul might have joy in you, and that my
      heart might leave this world with gladness because of you; that I might not be brought down
      with grief and sorrow to the grave, arise from the dust, my sons, and be men, and be
      determined in one mind, and in one heart united in all things, that ye may not come down into
      captivity; that ye may not be cursed with a sore cursing; and also, that ye may not incur the
      displeasure of a just God upon you, unto the destruction, yea, the eternal destruction of both
      soul and body. Awake, my sons; put on the armor of righteousness. Shake off the chains with
      which ye are bound, and come forth out of obscurity. and arise from the dust. Rebel no more
      against your brother, whose views have been glorious, and who hath kept the commandments from
      the time that we left Jerusalem, and who hath been an instrument in the hands of God, in
      bringing us forth into the land of promise: for were it not for him, we must have perished
      with hunger in the wilderness; nevertheless, ye sought to take away his life; yea, and he hath
      suffered much sorrow because of you. And I exceedingly fear and tremble because of you, lest
      he shall suffer again: for behold, ye have accused him that he sought power and authority over
      you; but I know that he hath not sought power nor authority over you; but he hath sought the
      glory of God, and your own eternal welfare. And ye have murmured because he hath been plain
      unto you. Ye say that he hath used sharpness; ye say that he hath been angry with you. But
      behold, his sharpness was the sharpness of the power of the word of God, which was in him; and
      that which ye call anger, was the truth, according to that which is in God, which he could not
      constrain, manifesting boldly concerning your iniquities. And it must needs be that the .power
      of God must be with him, even unto his commanding you, that ye must obey. But behold, it was
      not him, but it was the spirit of the Lord which was in him, which opened his mouth to
      utterance that he could not shut it. And now my son Laman, and also Lemuel and Sam, and also
      my sons which are the sons of Ishmael, beheld, if ye will hearken unto the voice of Nephi, ye
      shall not perish, And if ye will hearken unto him, I leave unto you a blessing, yea, even my
      first blessing, yea, even my blessing, and it shall rest upon him. And now, Zoram, I speak
      unto you: Behold, thou art the servant of Laban; nevertheless, thou hast been brought out of
      the land of Jerusalem, and I know that thou art a true friend of my son, Nephi, forever.
      Wherefore, because thou hast been faithful, thy seed shall be blessed with his seed, that they
      dwell in prosperity long upon the face of this land; and nothing, save it shall be iniquity
      among them, shall harm or disturb their prosperity upon the face of this land forever.
      --Wherefore, if ye shall keep the commandments of the Lord, the Lord hath consecrated this
      land for the security of thy seed with the seed of my son. </text>

    <text> And now, Jacob, I speak unto you; Thou art my first born in the days of my tribulation in
      the wilderness. And behold, in thy childhood, thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow,
      because of the rudeness of thy brethren. Nevertheless, Jacob, my first born in the wilderness,
      thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain.
      Wherefore, thy soul shall be blessed, and thou shall dwell safely with thy brother, Nephi; and
      thy days shall be spent in the service of thy God. --Wherefore, I know that thou art redeemed
      because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer: for thou hast beheld, that in the fulness of
      time, he cometh to bring salvation unto men. And thou hast beheld in thy youth, his glory;
      wherefore, thou art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the flesh: for the
      spirit is the same, yesterday, to-day, and forever. And the way is prepared from the fall of
      man, and salvation is free. And men are instructed sufficiently, that they know good from
      evil. And the law is given unto men. And by the law, no flesh is justified; or, by the ;law,
      men are cut off. Yea, by the temporal law, they were cut off; and also, by the spiritual law,
      they perish from that which is good, and become miserable forever. Wherefore, redemption
      cometh in and through the Holy Messiah: for he is full of grace and truth. Behold, he offereth
      himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those which have a broken
      heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered.
      Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the
      earth, that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save
      it be through the merits, and mercy, and the grace of the Holy Messiah, which layeth down his
      life according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the spirit, that he may bring
      to pass the resurrection of the dead, being the first that should rise. Wherefore, he is the
      first fruits unto God, inasmuch as he shall make intercession for all the children of men; and
      they that believe in him, shall be saved. And because of the intercession for all, all men
      cometh unto God; wherefore, they stand in the presence of Him, to be judged of Him, according
      to the truth and holiness which is in him. Wherefore, the ends of the law which the Holy One
      hath given, unto the inflicting of the punishment which is affixed, which punishment that is
      affixed is in opposition to that of the happiness which is affixed, to answer the ends of the
      atonement; for it must needs be, there is an opposition in all things. If not so, my first
      born in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass; neither wickedness;
      neither holiness nor misery; neither good or bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a
      compound in one; wherefore, if it should be one body, it must needs remain as dead, having no
      life, neither death nor corruption, nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense or
      insensibility. Wherefore, it must needs have been created for a thing of nought; wherefore,
      there would have been no purpose in the end of its creation. Wherefore, this things must needs
      destroy the wisdom of God, and his eternal purposes; and also, the power, and the mercy, and
      the justice of God. And if ye shall say there is no law, ye shall also say there is no sin. If
      ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there is no righteousness. --And if there be
      no righteousness, there be no happiness. And if there be no righteousness nor happiness, there
      be no punishment nor misery. And if these things are not, there is no God. And if there is no
      God, we are not, neither the earth: for there could have been no creation of things, neither
      to act nor to be acted upon; wherefore, all things must have vanished away. And now, my sons,
      I speak unto you these things, for your profit and learning: for there is a God, and he hath
      created all things, both the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them is; both
      things to act, and things to be acted upon; and to bring about his eternal purposes in the end
      of man, after that he created our first parents, and the beasts of the field, and the fowls of
      the air, and in fine, all things which are created, it must needs be that there was an
      opposition; even the forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet
      and the other bitter; wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man, that he should act for himself.
      Wherefore, man could not act for himself, save it should be that he were enticed by the one or
      the other. And I, Lehi, according to the things which I have read must needs suppose, that an
      angel of God, according to that which is written, had fallen from Heaven; wherefore, he became
      a Devil, having sought that which was evil before God. And because he had fallen from Heaven,
      and had become miserable forever, he sought also the misery of all mankind. --Wherefore, he
      sayeth unto Eve, yea, even that old serpent, which is the Devil, which is the father of all
      lies; wherefore he sayeth, Partake of the forbidden fruit, and ye shall not die, but ye shall
      be as God, knowing good and evil. And after that Adam and Eve had partaken of the forbidden
      fruit, they were driven out from the garden of Eden, to till the earth. And they brought forth
      children; yea, even the family of all the earth. And the days of children of men were
      prolonged, according to the will of God, that they might repent while in the flesh; wherefore,
      their state being a state of probation, and their time was lengthened, according to the
      commandments which the Lord God gave unto the children of men. For he gave a commandment that
      all men must repent; for he shewed unto all men that they were lost, because of the
      transgression of their parents. And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed, he would not
      have fallen; but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were
      created, must have remained in the same state which they were, after that they were created;
      and they must have remained forever, and had no end. And they would have had no children;
      wherefore, they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no
      misery: doing no good, for they knew no sin. But, behold, all things have been done in the
      wisdom of Him who knoweth all things. Adam fell, that men might be; and men are, that they
      might have joy. And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he might redeem the
      children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall, they have
      become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves. and not to be acted upon,
      save it be by the punishment of law, at the great and last day, according to the commandments
      which God hath given. Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given
      them which is expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life,
      through the mediation of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity
      and the power of the Devil: for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.
      And now, my sons, I would that ye looked to the great mediator, and hearken unto his great
      commandments; and be faithful unto his words, and choose eternal life, according to the will
      of his Holy Spirit, and not choose eternal death, according to the will of the flesh and the
      evil which is therein, which giveth the spirit of the Devil power to captivate, to bring you
      down to hell, that he may reign over you in his own kingdom. I have spoken these few words
      unto you all, my sons, in the last days of my probation; and I have chosen the good part
      according to the words of the prophet. And I have none another object save it be the
      everlasting welfare of your souls. --Amen. </text>

    <text> And now I speak unto you, Joseph, my last born. Thou wast born in the wilderness of mine
      afflictions; yea, in the days of my greatest sorrow, did thy mother bear thee. And may the
      Lord consecrate unto thee this land, which is a most precious land for thine inheritance and
      the inheritance of thy seed with thy brethren, for thy security forever, if it so be that ye
      shall keep the commandments of the Holy One of Israel. And now, Joseph, my last born, whom I
      have brought out of the wilderness of mine afflictions, may the Lord bless thee forever, for
      thy seed shall not utterly be destroyed. For behold, thou art the fruit of my loins; and I am
      a descendant of Joseph, which was carried captive into Egypt. And great was the covenants of
      the Lord, which he made unto Joseph; wherefore, Joseph truly saw our day. And he obtained a
      promise of the Lord, that out of the fruit of his loins, the Lord God would raise up a
      righteous branch unto the House of Israel; not the Messiah , but a branch which was broken
      off; nevertheless, to be remembered in the covenants of the Lord, that the Messiah should be
      made manifest unto them in the latter days in the spirit of power, unto the bringing of them
      out of the darkness unto the light; yea, out of hidden darkness and out of captivity unto
      freedom. For Joseph truly testified saying: A seer shall the Lord my God raise up, which shall
      be a choice seer unto the fruit of my loins. Yea, Joseph truly said thus saith the Lord unto
      me: A choice seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; and he shall be esteemed
      highly among the fruit of thy loins. And unto him will I give commandment, that he shall do a
      work for the fruit of thy loins, his brethren, which shall be of great worth unto them, even
      to the bringing of them to the knowledge of the covenants which I have made with thy fathers.
      And I will give unto him a commandment, that he shall do none other work, save the work which
      I shall command him. And I will make him great in mine eyes: for he shall do my work. And he
      shall be great like unto Moses, whom I have said I would raise up unto you, to deliver my
      people, O house of Israel. And Moses will I raise up, to deliver thy people out of the land of
      Egypt. Bat a seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; and unto him will I give
      power to bring forth my word unto the seed of thy loins; and not to the bringing forth my word
      only, saith the Lord, but to the convincing them of my word, which shall have already gone
      forth among them. Wherefore, the fruit of my loins shall write; and the fruit of the loins of
      Judah shall write; and that which shall be written by the fruit of thy loins, and also that
      which shall be written by the fruit of the loins of Judah, shall grow together, unto the
      confounding of false doctrines, and laying down of contentions, and establishing peace among
      the fruit of thy loins, and bringing them to the knowledge of their fathers in the latter
      days; and also to the knowledge of my covenants, saith the Lord. And out of weakness he shall
      be made strong, in that day when my work shall commence among all my people, unto the
      restoring thee, O house of Israel, saith the Lord. And thus prophesied Joseph, saying: Behold,
      that seer will the Lord bless; and they that seek to destroy him, shall be confounded: for
      this promise, of which I have obtained of the Lord, of the fruit of thy loins, shall be
      fulfilled. Behold, I am sure of the fulfilling of this promise. And his name shall be called
      after me; and it shall be after the name of his father. And he shall be like unto me; for the
      thing which the Lord shall bring forth by his hand, by the power of the Lord shall bring my
      people unto salvation; yea, thus prophesied Joseph. I am sure of this thing, even as I am sure
      of the promise of Moses: for the Lord hath said unto me, I will preserve thy seed forever. And
      the Lord hath said I will raise up a Moses; and I will give power unto him in a rod; and I
      will give judgment unto him in writing. Yet I will not loose his tongue, that he shall speak
      much: for I will not make him mighty in speaking. But I will write unto him my law, by the
      finger of mine own hand; and I will make a spokesman for him. And the Lord said unto me also,
      I will raise up unto the fruit of thy loins; and I will make ,for him a spokesman. And I,
      behold, I will give unto him, that he shall write the writing of the fruit of thy loins, unto
      the fruit of thy loins; and the spokesman of thy loins shall declare it. And the words which
      he shall write, shall be the words which is expedient in my wisdom, should go forth unto the
      fruit of thy loins. And it shall be as if the fruit of thy loins had cried unto them from the
      dust: for I know their faith. And they shall cry from the dust; yea, even repentance unto
      their brethren, even that after many generations have gone by them. And it shall come to pass
      that their cry shall go, even according to the simpleness of their words. Because of their
      faith, their words shall proceed forth out of my mouth unto their brethren, which are the
      fruit of thy loins; and the weakness of their words will I make strong in their faith, unto
      the remembering of my covenant which I made unto thy fathers. And now, behold, my son, Joseph,
      after this manner did my father of old prophesy. Wherefore, because of this covenant, thou art
      blessed: for thy seed shall not be destroyed, for they shall hearken unto the words of the
      Book. And there shall raise up one, mighty among them, which shall do much good, both in word
      and in deed, being an instrument in the hands of God, with exceeding faith, to work mighty
      wonders, and do that thing which is great in the sight of God, unto the bringing to pass much
      restoration unto the House of Israel, and unto the seed of thy brethren. And now, blessed art
      thou, Joseph. Behold, thou art little; wherefore, hearken unto the words of thy brother Nephi,
      and it shall be done unto thee, even according to the words which I have spoken. Remember, the
      words of thy dying father. Amen. </text>

    <text> And now, I, Nephi, speak concerning the prophecies of which my father hath spoken,
      concerning Joseph, who was carried into Egypt: For behold, he truly prophesied concerning all
      his seed. And the prophecies which he wrote, there are not many greater. And he prophesied
      concerning us, and our future generations: and they are written upon the plates of brass.
      Wherefore, after my father had made an end of the speaking concerning the prophecies of
      Joseph, he called the children of Laman, his sons, and his daughters, and sayeth unto them,
      Behold, my sons, and my daughters, which are the sons and the daughters of my first born. I
      would that ye should give ear unto my words: for the Lord God hath said, That inasmuch as ye
      shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye will not keep my
      commandments, ye shall be cut off from my presence. But behold, my sons and my daughters, I
      cannot go down to my grave, save I should leave a blessing upon you: For behold, I know that
      if ye are brought up in the right way that ye should go, ye will not depart from it.
      Wherefore, if ye are cursed, behold, I leave my blessing upon you, that the cursing may be
      taken from you, and be answered upon the heads of your parents. Wherefore, because of my
      blessing, the Lord God will not suffer that ye shall perish; wherefore, he will be merciful
      unto you, and unto your seed, forever. And it came to pass that after my father had made an
      end of speaking to the sons and daughters of Laman, he caused the sons and daughters of Lemuel
      to be brought before him. And he spake unto them, saying: Behold, my sons and my daughters,
      which are the sons and the daughters of my second son; behold, I leave unto you the same
      blessing which I left unto the sons and daughters of Laman; wherefore, thou shalt not utterly
      be destroyed; but in the end, thy seed shall be blessed. And it came to pass that when my
      father had made an end of speaking unto them, behold, it came to pass that he spake unto the
      sons of Ishmael, yea, and even all his household. And after that he had made an end of
      speaking unto them, he spake unto Sam, saying: Blessed art thou, and thy seed: for thou shalt
      inherit the land, like unto thy brother, Nephi. And thy seed shall be numbered with his seed;
      and thou shalt be even like unto thy brother, and thy seed like unto his seed; And thou shalt
      be blessed in all thy days. And it came to pass that after Lehi had spake unto all his
      household, according to the feelings of his heart, and the spirit of the Lord which was in
      him, he waxed old. And it came to pass that he died, and was buried. And it came to pass that
      not many days after his death, Laman and Lemuel, and the sons Ishmael, were angry with me,
      because of the admonitions of the Lord: for I, Nephi, was constrained to speak unto them
      according to the word. For I had spake many things unto them, and also my father, before his
      death; many of which sayings, are written upon mine other plates: for a more history part are
      written upon mine other plates. And upon these I write the things of my soul, and many of the
      Scriptures which are engraven upon the plates of brass: For my soul deliteth in the
      Scriptures; and my heart pondereth them, and writeth them for the learning and the profit of
      my children. Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth
      continually upon the things which I have seen and heard. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the
      great goodness of the Lord, in shewing me his great and marvelous works, my heart exclaimeth,
      O wretched man that I am; yea, my heart sorroweth, because of my flesh. My soul grieveth,
      because of mine iniquities. I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins
      which doth so easily beset me. And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my
      sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted. My God hath been my support; he hath led me
      through mine afflictions in the wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the
      great deep. He hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh. He hath
      confounded mine enemies, unto the causing of them to quake before me. Behold, he hath heard my
      cry by day, and he hath given me knowledge by visions in the night time. And by day have I
      waxed bold in mighty prayer before him; yea, my voice have I sent upon high; and angels came
      down and ministered unto me. And upon the wings of his spirit hath my body been carried away
      upon exceeding high mountains. And mine eyes hath beheld great things; yea, even too great for
      man; therefore I was bidden that I should not write them. O then, if I have seen so great
      things; if the Lord in his condescension unto the children of men, hath visited men in so much
      mercy, why should my heart weep, and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow, and my flesh
      wasteth away, and my strength slacken, because of mine afflictions? And why should I yield to
      sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why should I give away to temptations, that the evil one have
      place in my heart, to destroy my peace and afflict my soul? Why am I angry because of mine
      enemy? Awake, my soul! No longer droop in sin. Rejoice O my heart, and give place no more for
      the enemy of my soul. Do not anger again, because of mine enemies. Do not slacken my strength,
      because of mine afflictions. Rejoice, O my heart, and cry unto the Lord, and say, O Lord, I
      will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee, my God, and the rock of my
      salvation. O Lord, wilt thou redeem my soul? Wilt thou deliver me out of the hands of mine
      enemies? Wilt thou make me that I may shake at the appearance of sin? May the gates of hell be
      shut continually before me, because that my heart is broken and my spirit is contrite? O Lord,
      wilt thou shut the gates of thy righteousness before me, that I may walk in the path of the
      low valley, that I may be strict in the plain road? O Lord, wilt thou encircle me around in
      the robe of thy righteousness? O Lord, wilt thou make a way for mine escape before mine
      enemies? Wilt thou make my path straight before me? Wilt thou not place a stumbling block in
      my way? But that thou wouldst clear my way before me, and hedge not up my way, but the ways of
      mine enemy. O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever. I will not put
      my trust in the arm of flesh; for I know that cursed is he that putteth his trust in the arm
      of flesh. --Yea, cursed is he that putteth his trust in man, or maketh flesh his arm. Yea, I
      know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not
      amiss; therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the
      rock of my righteousness. Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine
      everlasting God. Amen. </text>

    <text> Behold, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cry much unto the Lord my God, because of the
      anger of my brethren. But behold, their anger did increase against me, insomuch that they did
      seek to take away my life. Yea, they did murmur against me, saying: Our younger brother
      thinketh to rule over us; and we have had much trial because of him; wherefore, now let us
      slay him, that we may not be afflicted more because of his words. For behold, we will not that
      he shall be our ruler: for it belongeth unto us, which are the elder brethren, to rule over
      this people. Now I do not write upon these plates, all the words which they murmured against
      me. But it sufficeth me to say, that they seek to take away my life. And it came to pass that
      the Lord did warn me, that I, Nephi, should depart from them, and flee into the wilderness,
      and all they which would go with me. Wherefore, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did take my
      family, and also Zoram and his family, and Sam, mine elder brother, and his family, and Jacob
      and Joseph, my younger brethren, and also my sisters, and all they which would go with me. And
      all they which would go with me, were they which believed in the warnings and the revelations
      of God; Wherefore, they did hearken unto my words. And we did take our tents and whatsoever
      things were possible for us, and did journey in the wilderness for the space of many days. And
      after that we had journied for the space of many days, we did pitch our tents. And my people
      would that we should call the name of the place Nephi; wherefore, we did call it Nephi. And
      all they which were with me, did take it upon them to call themselves the people of Nephi. And
      we did observe to keep the judgments, and the statues, and the commandments of the Lord, in
      all things, according to the law of Moses. And the Lord was with us; and we did prosper
      exceedingly: for we did sow seed, and we did reap again in abundance. And we began to raise
      flocks, and herds, and animals of every kind. And I, Nephi, had also brought the records which
      were engraven upon the plates of brass; and also the ball, or compass, which was prepared for
      my father, by the hand of the Lord, according to that which is written. And it came to pass
      that we began to prosper exceedingly, and to multiply in the land. And I, Nephi, did take the
      sword of Laban, and after the manner of it did make many swords, lest by any means the people
      which were now called Lamanites, should come upon us and destroy us: for I knew their hatred
      towards me and my children, and they which were called my people. And I did teach my people,
      that they should build buildings; and that they should work in all manner of wood, and of
      iron, and of copper, and of brass, and of steel, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious
      ores which were in great abundance. And I, Nephi, did build a temple; and I did construct it
      after the manner of the temple of Solomon, save it were not built of so many precious things:
      for they were not to be found upon the land; wherefore, it could not be built like unto
      Solomon's temple. But the manner of the construction was like unto the temple of Solomon; and
      the workmanship thereof was exceeding fine. And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cause my
      people that they should be industrious, and that they should labor with their hands. And it
      came to pass that they would that I should be their King. But I, Nephi, was desirous that they
      should have no King; nevertheless, I did do for them according to that which was in my power.
      And behold, the words of the Lord had been fulfilled unto my brethren, which he spake
      concerning them, that I should be their ruler and their teacher; wherefore, I had been their
      ruler and their teacher, according to the commandments of the Lord, until the time that they
      sought to take away my life. Wherefore, the word of the Lord was fulfilled which he spake unto
      me, saying: That inasmuch as they will not hearken unto thy words, they shall be cut off from
      his presence. And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing,
      because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they
      had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceeding fair and
      delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people, therefore the Lord God did cause
      a skin of blackness to come upon them. And thus saith the Lord God, I will cause that they
      shall be loathsome unto thy people, save they shall repent of their iniquities. And cursed
      shall be the seed of him that mixeth with their seed: for they shall be cursed even with the
      same cursing. And the Lord spake it, and it was done. And because of their cursing which was
      upon them, they did become and idle people, full of mischief and subtlety, and did seek in the
      wilderness for beasts of prey. And the Lord God said unto me, they shall be a scourge unto thy
      seed, to stir them up in remembrance of me, and inasmuch as they will not remember me, and
      hearken unto my words, they shall scourge them even unto destruction. And it came to pass that
      I, Nephi, did consecrate Jacob and Joseph, that they should be priests and teachers over the
      land of my people. And it came to pass that we lived after the manner of happiness. And thirty
      years had passed away from the time we left Jerusalem. And I, Nephi, had kept the record upon
      my plates, which I had made of my people thus far. And it came to pass that the Lord God said
      unto me, Make other plates; and thou shalt engraven many things upon them which are good in my
      sight, for the profit of thy people. --Wherefore, I, Nephi, to be obedient to the commandments
      of the Lord, went and made these plates upon which I have engraven these things. And I
      engravened that which is pleasing unto God. And if my people be pleased with the things of
      God, they be pleased with mine engravings which are upon these plates. And if my people desire
      to know the more particular part of the history of my people, they must search mine other
      plates. And if it sufficeth me to say, that forty years had passed away, and we had already
      had wars and contentions with our brethren. </text>

    <text> The words of Jacob, the brother of Nephi, which he spake unto the people of Nephi:
      Behold, my beloved brethren, that I, Jacob, having been called of God, and ordained after the
      manner of his holy order, and having been consecrated by my brother, Nephi, unto whom ye look
      as a king or a protector, and on whom ye depend for safety, behold, ye know that I have spoken
      unto you exceeding many things; nevertheless, I speak unto you again: for I am desirous for
      the welfare of your souls. Yea, mine anxiety is great for you; and ye yourselves know that it
      ever has been. For I have exhorted you with all diligence; and I have taught you the words of
      my father; and I have spoken unto you concerning all things which are written from the
      creation of the world. And now, behold, I would speak unto you concerning things which are,
      and which are to come; wherefore, I will read you the words of Isaiah. And they are the words
      which my brother hath desired me that I should speak unto you. And I speak them unto you for
      your sakes, that ye may learn and glorify the name of your God. And now, the words which I
      shall read, are they which Isaiah spake concerning all the House of Israel; wherefore, they
      may be likened unto you: for ye are of the House of Israel. And there are many things which
      have been spoken by Isaiah, which may be likened unto you, because that ye are of the House of
      Israel. And now, these are the words: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will lift up my hand
      to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people; and they shall bring thy sons in their
      arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders. And kings shall be thy nursing
      fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their faces
      towards the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord:
      for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me. And now I, Jacob, would speak somewhat
      concerning these words: For behold, the Lord hath shewn me that they which were at Jerusalem,
      from whence we came, have been slain and carried away captive; nevertheless, the Lord hath
      shewn unto me, that the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, should manifest himself unto them in
      the flesh; and after that he should manifest himself, they should scourge him and crucify him,
      according to the words of the angel, which spake it unto me. And after that they have hardened
      their hearts and stiffened their necks against the Holy One of Israel, behold, the judgments
      of the Holy One of Israel shall come upon them. And the day cometh that they shall be smitten
      and afflicted. Wherefore, after they are driven to and fro, for thus saith the angel, many
      shall be afflicted in the flesh and shall not be suffered to perish, because of the prayers of
      the faithful: wherefore, they shall be scattered, and smitten, and hated; nevertheless, the
      Lord will be merciful unto them, that when they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer,
      they shall be gathered together again to the land of their inheritance. And blessed are the
      Gentiles, they of whom the prophet hath written: for behold, if it so be that they shall
      repent and fight not against Zion, and do not unite themselves to that great and abominable
      church, they shall be saved: for the Lord God will fulfill his covenants which he hath made
      unto his children; and for this cause, the prophet hath written these things. Wherefore, they
      that fight against Zion and the covenant people of the Lord, shall lick up the dust of their
      feet; and the people of the Lord shall not be ashamed. For the people of the Lord are they
      which wait for him: for they still wait for the coming of the Messiah. And behold, according
      to the words of the prophet, the Messiah will set himself again the second time, to recover
      them; wherefore, he will manifest himself unto them in power and great glory, unto the
      destruction of their enemies, when that day cometh when they shall believe in him; and none
      will he destroy that believeth in him. And they that believe not in him, shall be destroyed,
      both by fire, and by tempest, and by earthquakes, and by bloodshed, and by pestilence, and by
      famine. And they shall know that the Lord is God, the Holy One of Israel: for shall the prey
      be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered? But thus saith the Lord: Even the
      captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered:
      for the Mighty God shall deliver his covenant people. For thus saith the Lord: I will contend
      with them that contendeth with thee, and I will feed them that oppress thee, with their own
      flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine; and all flesh shall
      know that I the Lord am thy saviour and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob. </text>

    <text> Yea, for thus saith the Lord: Have I put thee away, or have I cast thee off forever? For
      thus saith the Lord: Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement? To whom have I put thee
      away, or to which of my creditors have I sold you? Yea, to whom have I sold you? Behold, for
      your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away;
      wherefore, when I come, there was no man; when I called, yea, there was none to answer. O
      House of Israel, is my hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem, or have I no power to
      deliver? Behold, at my rebuke, I dry up the sea, I make their rivers a wilderness and their
      fish to stink, because the waters are dried up; and they die because of thirst. I clothe the
      heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering. The Lord God hath given me the
      tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season unto thee, O House of
      Israel. When ye are weary, he waketh morning by morning. He waketh mine ear to hear as the
      learned. The Lord God hath appointed mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away
      back. I gave my back to the smiter, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair. I hid not
      my face from shame and spitting, for the Lord God will help me: therefore shall I not be
      confounded. Therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed;
      and the Lord is near, and he justifieth me. Who will contend with me? let us stand together.
      Who is mine adversary? let him come near me, and I will smite him with the strength of my
      mouth: for the Lord God will help me. And all they which shall condemn me, behold, all they
      shall wax old as a garment, and the moth shall eat them up. Who is among you that feareth the
      Lord; that obeyeth the voice of his servant; that walketh in darkness, and hath no light?
      Behold, all ye that kindleth fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the
      light of your fire, and in the sparks which ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand:
      Ye shall lie down in sorrow. </text>

    <text> Hearken unto me, ye that follow after righteousness: Look unto the rock from whence ye
      are hewn, and the hole of the pit from whence ye are digged. Look unto Abraham, your father;
      and unto Sarah, she that bare you: for I called him alone, and blessed him. For the Lord shall
      comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden,
      and her desert like the garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness shall be found therein,
      thanksgiving and the voice of melody. Hearken unto me my people; and give ear unto me, O my
      nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light thing
      of the people. My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine arm shall judge
      the people. The isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm shall they trust. Lift up your eyes
      to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke,
      and the earth shall wax old like a garment; and they that dwell therein, shall die in like
      manner. But my salvation shall be forever; and my righteousness shall not be abolished.
      Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart I have written my law;
      fear ye not the reproach of men; neither be ye afraid of their revilings: for the moth shall
      eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool. But my righteousness shall
      be forever; and my salvation from generation to generation. Awake, awake! Put on strength O
      arm of the Lord: awake as in the ancient days. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and
      wounded the dragon? Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep;
      that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over? Therefore, the
      redeemed of the Lord shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy and
      holiness shall be upon their heads; and they shall obtain gladness and joy: sorrowing and
      mourning shall flee away. I am he; yea, I am he that comforteth you: Behold, who art thou,
      that thou shouldst be afraid of man, which shall die, and of the Son of man, which shall be
      made like unto grass; and forgetest the Lord thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens,
      and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually every day, because of the
      fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? And where is the fury of the oppressor?
      The captive exile hasteneth, that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor
      that his bread should fail. --But I am the Lord thy God, whose waves roared: the Lord of Hosts
      is my name. And I have put my words in thy mouth, and hath covered thee in the shadow of mine
      hand, that I may plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion,
      Behold, thou art my people. Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand
      of the Lord the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling rung out;
      and none to guide her among all the sons she hath brought forth; neither that taketh her by
      the hand, of all the sons she hath brought up. These two sons are come unto thee; who shall be
      sorry for thee? thy desolation and destruction, and the famine and the sword: And by whom
      shall I comfort thee? Thy sons have fainted, save these two: they lie at the heads of all the
      streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the Lord, the rebuke of thy
      God. Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, and not with wine: thus saith thy
      Lord, The Lord and thy God pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine
      hand the cup of trembling, the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again.
      But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which I said to thy soul, Bow down,
      that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them
      that went over. Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O
      Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee, the uncircumcised
      and the unclean. Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from
      the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion. </text>

    <text> And now, my beloved brethren, I have read these things that ye might know concerning the
      covenants of the Lord; that he hath covenanted with all the House of Israel; that he hath
      spoken unto the Jews, by the mouth of his holy prophets, even from the beginning down, from
      generation to generation, until the time cometh that they shall be restored to the true Church
      and fold of God; when they shall be gathered home to the lands of their inheritance, and shall
      be established in all their lands of promise. Behold, my beloved brethren, I speak unto these
      things that ye may rejoice, and lift up your heads forever, because of the blessings which the
      Lord God shall bestow upon your children. For I know that thou hast searched much, many of
      you, to know of things to come; wherefore I know that ye know that our flesh must waste away
      and die; nevertheless, in our bodies, we shall see God. Yea, and I know that ye know, that in
      the body he shall shew himself unto they at Jerusalem, from whence we came; for it is
      expedient that it should be among them; for it behoveth the Great Creator that he suffereth
      himself to become subject unto man, in the flesh, and die for all men, that all men might
      become subject unto him. For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful plan of
      the Great Creator, there must needs be a power of resurrection, and the resurrection must
      needs come unto man by reason of the fall; and the fall came by reason of transgression; and
      because man became fallen, they were cut off from the presence of the Lord; wherefore it must
      needs be an infinite atonement; save it should be an infinite atonement, this corruption could
      not put on corruption. Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man, must needs have
      remained to an endless duration. And if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to
      crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more. O the wisdom of God! his mercy and grace! For
      behold, if the flesh should rise no more, our spirits must become subject to that Angel which
      fell from before the presence of the Eternal God, and became the Devil, to rise no more. And
      our spirits must have become like unto him, and we become Devils, Angels to a Devil, to be
      shut out from the presence of our God, and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like
      unto himself; yea, to that being who beguiled our first parents; who transformeth himself nigh
      unto an angel of light, and stirreth up the children of men unto secret combinations of
      murder, and all manner of secret works of darkness. O how great the goodness of our God, who
      prepareth a way for our escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster, death
      and hell, which I call the death of the body, and also the death of the spirit. And because of
      the way of deliverance of our God, the Holy One of Israel, this death, of which I have spoken,
      which is the temporal, shall deliver up its dead; which death is the grave. And this death of
      which I have spoken, which is the spiritual death is hell; wherefore, death and hell must
      deliver up its dead, and hell must deliver up its captive spirits, and the grave must deliver
      up its captive bodies, and the bodies and the spirits of men will be restored, one to the
      other: and it is by the power of the resurrection of the Holy One of Israel. O how great the
      plan of our God! For on the other hand, the paradise of God must deliver up the spirits of the
      righteous, and the grave deliver up the body of the righteous; and the spirit and the body is
      restored to itself again, and all men become incorruptible, and immortal, and they are living
      souls, having a perfect knowledge like unto us, in the flesh; save it be that our knowledge
      shall be perfect; wherefore, we shall have a perfect knowledge of all our guilt, and our
      uncleanness, and our nakedness; and the righteous shall have a perfect knowledge of their
      enjoyment, and their righteousness, being clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe of
      righteousness. And it shall come to pass, that when all men shall have passed from this first
      death unto life, inasmuch as they have become immortal, they must appear before the judgment
      seat, and then they must be judged according to the holy judgment of God. And assuredly, as
      the Lord liveth, for the Lord God hath spoken it, and it is his eternal word, which cannot
      pass away, that they which are righteous, shall be righteous still, and they which are filthy,
      shall be filthy still; wherefore, they which are filthy, are the Devil and his angels; and
      they shall go away into everlasting fire, prepared for them; and their torment is a lake of
      fire and brimstone, whose flames ascendeth up forever and ever, and hath no end. O the
      greatness and the justice of our God! For he executeth all his words, and they have gone forth
      out of his mouth, and his law must be fulfilled. But, behold, the righteous, the saints of the
      Holy One of Israel, they which have believed in the Holy One of Israel; they which have
      endured the crosses of the world, and despised the shame of it; they shall inherit the Kingdom
      of God, which was prepared for them from the foundation of the world: and their joy shall be
      full forever. O the greatness of the mercy of our God, the Holy One of Israel! For he
      delivereth his saints from that awful monster, the Devil, and death and hell, and that lake of
      fire and brimstone, which is endless torment. O how great the holiness of our God! For he
      knoweth all things, and there is not any thing, save he know it. And he cometh into the world
      that he may save all men, if they will hearken unto his voice: for behold, he suffereth the
      pains of all men; yea, the pains of every living creature, both men women and children, which
      belong to the family of Adam. --And he suffereth this, that the resurrection might pass upon
      all men, that all might stand before him, at the great and judgment day. And he commandeth all
      men that they must repent, and be baptised in his name, having perfect faith in the Holy One
      of Israel, or they cannot be saved in the Kingdom of God. And if they will not repent and
      believe in his name, and be baptised in his name, and endure to the end, they must be damned;
      for the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, hath spoken it; wherefore he hath given a law; and
      where there is no law given, there is no punishment; and where there is no punishment, there
      is no condemnation; and where there is no condemnation, the mercies of the Holy One of Israel
      hath claim upon them, because of the atonement: for they are delivered by the power of him:
      for the atonement satisfieth the demands of his justice upon all those who have not the law
      given to them, that they are delivered from that awful monster, death and hell, and the Devil,
      and the lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment; and they are restored to that
      God who gave them breath, which is the Holy One of Israel. But wo unto him that hath the law
      given; yea, that hath all the commandments of God, like unto us, and that transgresseth them,
      and that wasteth the days of his probation: for awful is his state! O that cunning plan of the
      evil one! O the vainness, and the frailties, and the foolish of men! When they are learned,
      they think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel of God, for they set it aside,
      supposing they know of themselves. Wherefore, their wisdom if foolishness, and it profiteth
      them not. Wherefore they shall perish. But to be learned is good, if it so be that they
      hearken unto the counsels of God. But wo unto the rich, which are rich as to the things of the
      world. For because that they are rich, they despise the poor, and they persecute the meek, and
      their hearts are upon their treasures; wherefore their treasure is their God. And behold,
      their treasure shall perish with them also. And wo unto the deaf, that will not hear: for they
      shall perish. Wo unto the blind, that will not see: for they shall perish also. Wo unto the
      uncircumcised of heart: for a knowledge of their iniquities shall smite them at the last day.
      Wo unto the liar: for he shall be thrust down to hell. Wo unto the murderer, who deliberately
      killeth: for he shall die. Wo unto them who commit whoredoms: for they shall be thrust down to
      hell. Yea, wo unto they that worship Idols: for the Devil of all Devil's delighteth in them.
      And, in fine, wo unto all they that die in their sins: for they shall return to God, and
      behold his face, and remain in their sins. O, my beloved brethren, remember the awfulness in
      transgressing against that holy God, and also the awfulness of yielding to the enticing of
      that cunning one. Remember, to be carnally minded, is death, and to be spiritually minded, is
      life eternal. O, my beloved brethren, give ear to my words. Remember the greatness of the Holy
      One of Israel. Do not say that I have spoken hard things against you: for if ye do, ye will
      revile against the truth: for I have spoken the words of your Maker. I know that the words of
      truth are hard against all uncleanness; but the righteous fear it not, for they love the
      truth, and are not shaken. O then, my beloved brethren, come unto the Lord, the Holy One.
      Remember that his paths are righteousness. Behold, the way for man is narrow, but it lieth in
      a straight course before him, and the keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel: and he
      employeth no servant there; and there is none other way, save it be by the gate, for he cannot
      be deceived; for the Lord God is his name. And whoso knocketh, to him will he open, and the
      wise, and the learned, and they that are rich, which are puffed up because of their learning,
      and their wisdom, and their riches; yea, they are they, whom he despiseth; and save they shall
      cast these things away, and consider themselves fools before God, and come down in the depths
      of humility, he will not open unto them. But the things of the wise and the prudent, shall be
      hid from them forever; yea, that happiness which is prepared for the Saints. O my beloved
      brethren, remember my words: Behold, I take off my garments, and I shake them before you: I
      pray the God of my salvation that he view me with his All-searching eye; wherefore, ye shall
      know at the last day, when all men shall be judged of their works, that the God of Israel did
      witness that I shook your iniquities from my soul, and that I stand with brightness before
      him, and am rid of your blood. O my beloved brethren, turn away from your sins; shake off the
      chains of him that would bind you fast; come unto that God which is the rock of your
      salvation. Prepare your souls for that glorious day, when justice shall be administered unto
      the righteous; even the day of judgment, that ye may not shrink with awful fear; that ye may
      not remember your awful guilt in perfectness, and be constrained to exclaim, Holy, holy are
      thy judgments, O Lord God Almighty. But I know my guilt; I transgressed thy law, and my
      transgressions are mine; and the Devil hath obtained me, that I am prey to his awful misery.
      But behold, my brethren, is it expedient that I should awake you to an awful reality of these
      things? Would I harrow up your souls, if your minds were pure? Would I be plain unto you
      according to the plainness of the truths, if ye were freed from sin? Behold, if ye were holy,
      I would speak unto you of holiness; but as ye are not holy, and ye look upon me as a teacher,
      it must needs be expedient that I teach you the consequences of sin. Behold, my soul abhorreth
      sin, and my heart delighteth in righteousness; and I will praise the holy name of my God.
      Come. my brethren, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters; and he that hath no money,
      come buy and eat; yea, come buy wine and milk without money and without price. Wherefore, do
      not spend money for that which is of no worth, nor your labor for that which cannot satisfy.
      Hearken diligently unto me, and remember the words which I have spoken; and come unto the Holy
      One of Israel, and feast upon that which perisheth not, neither can be corrupted, and let your
      soul delight in fatness. Behold, my beloved brethren, remember the words of your God; pray
      unto him continually by day, and give thanks unto his holy name at night. Let your hearts
      rejoice, and behold how great the covenants of the Lord, and how great his condescentions unto
      the children of men; and because of his greatness, and his grace and mercy, he hath promised
      unto us that our seed shall not utterly be destroyed, according to the flesh, but that he
      would preserve them; and in future generations, they shall become a righteous branch unto the
      House of Israel. And now, my brethren, I would speak unto you more; but on the morrow I will
      declare unto you the remainder of my words. Amen. </text>

    <text> And now, I, Jacob, speak unto you again, my beloved brethren, concerning this righteous
      branch of which I have spoken. For behold, the promises which we have obtained, are promises
      unto us according to the flesh; wherefore, as it hath been shown unto me that many of our
      children shall perish in the flesh, because of unbelief, neverthelass, God will be merciful
      unto many; and our children shall be restored, that they may come to that which will give them
      the true knowledge of their Redeemer. Wherefore, as I said unto you, it must needs be
      expedient that Christ, (for in the last night the Angel spake unto me that this should be his
      name,) should come among the Jews, among they which are the more wicked part of the world; and
      they shall crucify him: For thus it behooveth our God; and there is none other nation on earth
      that would crucify their God. For should the mighty miracles be wrought among other nations,
      they would repent, and know that he be their God; but because of priest-crafts and iniquities,
      they at Jerusalem will stiffen their necks against him, that he be crucified. Wherefore,
      because of their iniquities, destructions, famines, pestilences, and bloodsheds, shall come
      upon them; and they which shall not be destroyed, shall be scattered among all nations. But
      behold, thus saith the Lord God: When the day cometh that they shall believe in me, that I am
      Christ, they have I covenanted with their fathers that they shall be restored in the flesh,
      upon the earth, unto the lands of their inheritance. And it shall come to pass that they shall
      be gathered in from their long dispersion, from the isles of the sea, and from the four parts
      of the earth; and the nation of the Gentiles shall be great in the eyes of me, saith God, in
      carrying them forth to the lands of their inheritance. Yea, the kings of the Gentiles shall be
      nursing fathers unto them, and their queens shall become nursing mothers, wherefore, the
      promises of the Lord are great unto the Gentiles: for he hath spoken it, and who can dispute.
      But behold, This land, saith God, shall be a land of thine inheritance; and the Gentiles shall
      be blessed upon the land. And this land shall be a land of liberty unto the Gentiles; and
      there shall be no kings upon the land, which shall raise up unto the Gentiles. And I will
      fortify this land against all other nations; and he that fighteth against Zion, shall perish,
      saith God: for he that raiseth up a king against me, shall perish. For I the Lord, the King of
      Heaven, will be their king; and I will be a light unto them forever, that hear my words.
      Wherefore, for this cause, that my covenants may be fulfilled, which I have made unto the
      children of men, that I will do unto them while they are in the flesh, I must needs destroy
      the secret works of darkness, and of murders of abomination; wherefore, he that fighteth
      against Zion, both Jew and Gentile, both bond and free, both male and female, shall perish:
      for they are they which are the whore of all the earth; for they which are not for me, are
      against me, saith our God. For I will fulfill my promises which I have made unto the children
      of men, that I will do unto them while they are in the flesh. Wherefore, my beloved brethren,
      thus saith our God: I will afflict thy seed by the hand of the Gentiles; nevertheless, I will
      soften the hearts of the Gentiles, that they shall be like unto a father to them; wherefore,
      the Gentiles shall be blessed and numbered among the House of Israel. --Wherefore, I will
      consecrate this land unto thy seed and they which shall be numbered among thy seed, forever,
      for the land of their inheritance: For it is a choice land, saith God unto me, above all other
      lands; wherefore, I will have all men that dwell thereon, that they shall worship me, saith
      God. And now, my beloved brethren, seeing that our merciful God hath given us so great
      knowledge concerning these things, let us remember him, and lay aside our sins, and not hang
      our heads, for we are not cast off; nevertheless, we have been driven out of the land of our
      inheritance; but we have been led to a better land: for the Lord hath made the sea our path,
      and we are upon an isle of the sea. But great is the promises of the Lord unto they which are
      upon the isles of the sea; wherefore, as it sayeth isles, there must needs be more than this;
      and they are inhabited also by our brethren. For behold, the Lord God hath led away from time
      to time from the House of Israel, according to his will and pleasure. And now, behold, the
      Lord remembereth all they which have been broken off; wherefore, he remembereth us also.
      Therefore cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves: to choose
      the way of everlasting death, or the way of eternal life. Wherefore, my beloved brethren,
      reconcile yourselves to the will of God, and not to the will of the Devil and the flesh; and
      remember that after ye are reconciled unto God, that it is only in and through the grace of
      God that ye are saved. Wherefore, may God raise you from death, by the power of the
      resurrection; and also from everlasting death, by the power of the atonement, that ye may be
      received into the Eternal Kingdom of God, that ye may praise him through Grace Divine. Amen.

    <text> And now Jacob spake many more things to my people at that time; nevertheless, only these
      things have I caused to be written: for the things which I have written, sufficeth me. And now
      I, Nephi, write more of the words of Isaiah: for my soul delighteth in his words. For I will
      liken his words unto my people; and I will send them forth unto all my children: for he verily
      saw my Redeemer, even as I have seen him. And my brother Jacob also hath seen him as I have
      seen him; wherefore, I will send their words forth unto my children, to prove unto them that
      my words are true. Wherefore, by the words of three, God hath said, I will establish my word.
      Nevertheless, God sendeth more witnesses; and he proveth all his words. Behold, my soul
      delighteth in proving unto my people the truth of the coming of Christ: for, this end hath the
      law of Moses been given; and all things which have been given of God from the beginning of the
      world, unto man, are the typifying of him. And also, my soul delighteth in the covenants of
      the Lord which he hath made to our fathers; yea, my soul delighteth in his grace, and his
      justice, and power, and mercy, in the great and eternal plan of deliverance from death. And my
      soul delighteth in proving unto my people, that save Christ should come, all men must perish.
      For if there be no Christ, there be no God; and if there be no God, we are not, for there
      could have been no creation. --But there is a God, and he is Christ; and he cometh in the
      fulness of his own time. And now, I write some of the words of Isaiah, that whoso of my people
      which shall see these words, may lift up their hearts and rejoice for all men. Now, these are
      the words; and ye may liken them unto you, and unto all men. </text>

    <text> The word that Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem: And it shall
      come to pass in the last days, when the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in
      the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow
      into it, and many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the
      Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in
      his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
      And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their
      swords, plough-shares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword
      against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. O house of Jocob, come ye and let us
      walk in the light of the Lord; yea, come, for ye have all gone astray, every one to his wicked
      ways. Therefore, O Lord, thou hast forsaken thy people, the house of Jacob, because they be
      replenished from the east, and hearken unto soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please
      themselves in the children of strangers. Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither
      is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any
      end of their chariots: their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own
      hands, --that which their own fingers have made: and the mean man boweth down, and the great
      man humbleth himself not: therefore forgive him not. O ye wicked ones, enter into the rock,
      and hide thee in the dust, for the fear of the Lord, and the glory of his majesty shall smite
      thee. And it shall come to pass that the lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the
      haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. For
      the day of the Lord of hosts soon cometh upon all nations; yea, upon every one; yea, upon the
      proud and lofty, and upon every one which is lifted up; and he shall be brought low: yea, and
      the day of the Lord shall come upon all the cedars of Lebanon, for they are high and lifted
      up; and upon all the oaks of Bashan, and upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills,
      and upon all the nations which are lifted up, and upon every people, and upon every high
      tower, and upon every fenced wall, and upon all the ships of the sea, and upon all the ships
      of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures. And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and
      the haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. And
      the idols he shall utterly abolish. And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into
      the caves of the earth, for the fear of the Lord shall come upon them; and the glory of his
      majesty shall smite them, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. In that day a man shall
      cast his idols of silver and his idols of gold, which he hath made for himself to worship, to
      the moles and to the bats; to go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged
      rocks, for the fear of the Lord shall come upon them, and the majesty of his glory shall smite
      them when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth. Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his
      nostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of? </text>

    <text> For behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the
      stay and the staff, the whole staff of bread, and the whole stay of water, the mighty man, and
      the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient, the captain of
      fifty, and the honorable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent
      orator. And I will give children unto them to be their princes, and babes shall rule over
      them. And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor:
      the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the
      honorable. When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, and shall
      say, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let not this ruin come under thy hand: in that
      day shall he swear, saying, I will not be a healer; for in my house there is neither bread or
      clothing: make me not a ruler of the people. For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen:
      because their tongues are their doings have been against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his
      glory. The shew of their countenance doth witness against them, and doth declare their sin to
      be even as Sodom, and they cannot hide it. Wo unto their souls! for they have rewarded evil
      unto themselves. Say unto the righteous, that it is well with them: for they shall eat the
      fruit of their doings. Wo unto the wicked! for they shall perish: for the reward of their
      hands shall be upon them. And my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over
      them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the ways of thy paths.
      The Lord standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people. The Lord will enter into
      judgment with the ancients of his people, with the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the
      vineyard, and the spoil of the poor in your houses. What mean ye? Ye beat my people to pieces,
      and grind the faces of the poor, saith the Lord God of hosts. Moreover the Lord saith, Because
      the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched necks and wanton eyes, walking and
      mincing as they go,, and making a tinkling with their feet: therefore the Lord will smite with
      a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will discover their secret
      parts. In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of tinkling ornaments, and cauls, and
      round tires like the moon, the chains, and the bracelets, and mufflers, the bonnets, and the
      ornaments of the legs, and the head-bands, and the tablets, and the ear-rings, the rings, and
      nose-jewels, the changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the
      crisping-pins, the glasses, and the fine linen, and hoods, and the vails. And it shall come to
      pass, instead of sweet smell, there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle, a rent; and
      instead of well set hair, baldness; and instead of a stomacher, a girding of sack cloth:
      burning instead of beauty. Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war. And her
      gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall be desolate, and shall sit upon the ground.

    <text> And then I will sing to my well beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My
      well-beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill: and he fenced it, and gathered out the
      stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it,
      and also made a wine-press therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it
      brought forth wild grapes. And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I
      pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard. What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I
      have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, it brought
      forth wild grapes. And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take
      away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and I will break down the wall thereof, and
      it shall be trodden down: and I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but
      there shall come up briars and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain
      upon it. For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the House of Israel, and the men of Judah
      his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, and behold oppression; for righteousness, but
      behold a cry. Wo unto them that join house to house, till there can be no place, that they may
      be placed alone in the midst of the earth! In mine ears, said the Lord of hosts, Of a truth
      many houses shall be desolate, and great and fair cities without inhabitant. Yea, ten acres of
      vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of a horner shall yield an ephah. Wo unto them
      that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until
      night, and wine inflame them! And the harp, and the viol the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are
      in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither consider the operation of
      his hands. Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge: and
      their honorable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst. Therefore hell
      hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their
      multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it. And the mean man
      shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be
      humbled: but the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be
      sanctified in righteousness. Then shall the lamb feed after their manner, and the waste places
      of the fat ones shall strangers eat. Wo unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and
      sin as it were with a cart-rope: that say, Let him make speed, hasten his work, that we may
      see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it.
      Wo unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for
      darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! Wo unto the wise in their own eyes,
      and prudent in their own sight! Wo unto the mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to
      mingle strong drink: which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of
      the righteous from him! Therefore as the fire devoureth and the stubble, and the flame
      consumeth the chaff, their root shall be rottenness, and their blossoms shall go up as dust:
      because they have cast away the law of the Lord of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy
      One of Israel. Therefore is the anger of the Lord kindled against his people, and he hath
      stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and
      their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned
      away, but his hand stretched out still. And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far,
      and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth; and behold they shall come with speed
      swiftly: none shall be weary nor stumble among them; non shall slumber or sleep; neither shall
      the girdle of their loins be loosed, not the lachet of their shoes be broken: whose arrows
      shall be sharp, and all their bows bent, and their horses' hoofs shall be counted like flint,
      and their wheels like a whirlwind, their roaring like a lion. --They shall roar like young
      lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry away safe, and none
      shall deliver. And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea: and
      if they look unto the land, behold, darkness and sorrow, and the light is darkened in the
      heavens thereof. </text>

    <text> In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and
      lifted up, and his train filled the temple. Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six
      wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he
      did fly. And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of hosts: the
      whole earth is full of his glory. And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that
      cried, and the house was filled with smoke. Then said I, Wo me! for I am undone; because I a
      man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have
      seen the King, the Lord of hosts. --Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal
      in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: and he laid it upon my
      mouth, and said, Lo, this has touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin
      purged. Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?
      Then I said, Here I; send me. And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but they
      understand not; and see ye indeed, but they perceived not. Make the heart of this people fat,
      and make their ears heavy. and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with
      their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed. Then said I, Lord,
      how long? And he said, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without
      man, and the land be utterly desolate; and the Lord have removed men far away, for there shall
      be a great forsaking in the midst of the land. But yet in there shall be a tenth, and they
      shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil-tree, and as an oak whose substance is in them,
      when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of
      Judah, and Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up
      towards Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it. And it was told the
      house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the
      heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind. Then said the Lord unto
      Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of
      the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field; and say unto him, Take heed, and be
      quiet; fear not, neither be faint-hearted for the two tails of these smoking fire-brands, for
      the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. Because Syria, Ephraim, and
      the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying, Let us go up against Judah,
      and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, yea
      the son of Tabeal: thus saith the Lord God, it shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.
      For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus, Rezin: and within threescore and
      five years shall Ephraim be broken, that it be not a people. And the head of Ephraim is
      Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall
      not be established. Moreover, the Lord spake again unto Ahaz, saying, Ask thee a sign of the
      Lord thy God; ask it either in the depths, or in the heights above. But Ahaz said, I will not
      ask, neither will I tempt the Lord. And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small
      thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also? Therefore the Lord himself shall
      give you a sign: Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and shall bear a son, and shall call his
      name Immanuel. Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and to
      choose the good. For before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good, the
      land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings. The Lord shall bring upon thee,
      and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that
      Ephraim departed from Judah, the king of Assyria. And it shall come to pass in that day, that
      the Lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of Egypt, and for the bee that
      is in the land of Assyria. And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate
      valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes. In the same
      day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, by them beyond the river, by the king of
      Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard. And it shall
      come to pass in that day, a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep; and it shall come to
      pass, for the abundance of milk they shall give, he shall eat butter: for butter and honey
      shall every one eat that is left in the land. --And it shall come to pass in that day, every
      place shall be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, which shall be
      for briers and thorns. With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all the land
      shall become briers and thorns. And all the hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there
      shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but is shall be for the sending forth of
      oxen, and treading of lesser cattle. </text>

    <text> Moreover, the word of the Lord said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it with
      a man's pen concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz. And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record,
      Uriah the priest, and Zechariah, the son of Jeberechiah. And I went unto the prophetess; and
      she conceived and bear a son. Then said the Lord to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
      For behold, the child shall not have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother, before the
      riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.
      The Lord spake also unto me again, saying, Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of
      Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son; now therefore, behold, the
      Lord bringeth up upon the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and
      all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks: and he
      shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck; and
      the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel. Associate
      yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear all ye of far
      countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be
      broken in pieces. Take counsel together and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it
      shall not stand: for God is with us. For the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand, and
      instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying, Say ye not. A
      confederacy, to all to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear,
      nor be afraid. Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself, and let him be your fear, and let him be
      your dread. And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of
      offence to both the Houses of Israel, for a gin and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
      And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.
      --Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. And I will wait upon the Lord, that
      hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him. Behold, I and the children
      whom the Lord hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts,
      which dwelleth in mount Zion. And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have
      familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and mutter: should not a people seek unto their
      God? for the living to hear from the dead? to the law and to the testimony: and if they speak
      not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them. And they shall pass
      through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall come to pass, that when they shall be
      hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and look upward. And
      they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness, dimness of anguish, and shall
      be driven to darkness. </text>

    <text> Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation, when at the first he
      lightly afflicted the land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, and afterwards did more
      grievously afflict by the way of the Red Sea beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the nations. The
      people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the
      shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. Thou hast multiplied the nations, and
      increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice
      when they divide the spoil. For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his
      shoulder, the rod of his oppressor. For every battle of the warrior with confused noise, and
      garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire. For unto us a child
      is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name
      shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of
      Peace. Of the increase of government and peace there is no end, upon the throne of David, and
      upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and justice from henceforth
      even forever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this. The Lord sent his word unto
      Jacob and it hath lighted upon Israel. And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the
      inhabitants of Samaria, that say in the pride and the stoutness of heart, The bricks are
      fallen down, but we will change them into cedars. Therefore the Lord shall set up the
      adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together; the Syrians before, and the
      Philistines behind: and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is
      not turned away, but his hand stretched out still. For the people turneth not unto him that
      smiteth them, neither do they seek the Lord of hosts. Therefore will the Lord cut off from
      Israel head and tail, branch and rush in one day. --The ancient, he is the head; and the
      prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail. For the leaders of this people cause them to err;
      and they that are led of them are destroyed. Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their
      young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one of the is a
      hypocrite and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not
      turned away, but his hand stretched out still. For the wickedness burneth as the fire; it
      shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forests, and they
      shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke. --Through the wrath of the Lord of hosts is the
      land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his
      brother. And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left
      hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:
      Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: they together shall be against Judah. For all this
      his anger is not turned away, but his hand stretched out still. </text>

    <text> Wo unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have
      prescribed; to turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of
      my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless! And what will
      ye do in the day of visitation, and in desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye
      flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory? Without me they shall bow down under the
      prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but
      his hand stretched out still. O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand
      is their indignation. I will send him against a hypocritical nation, and against the people of
      my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them
      down like the mire of the streets . Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think
      so; but in his heart it is to destroy and cut off nations not a few. For he saith, Are not my
      princes altogether kings? Is not Calno as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not Samaria
      as Damascus? As my hand hath founded the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did
      excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria; shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her
      idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols? Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord
      hath performed his whole work upon the mount Zion and upon Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit
      of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks. For he saith, By
      the strength of my hand and by my wisdom I have done these things; for I am prudent: and I
      have moved the borders of the [people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down
      the inhabitants like a valiant man: and my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people:
      and as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none
      that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped. Shall the axe boast itself against him
      that heweth therewith? Shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if the rod
      should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as
      if it were no wood. Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones
      leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire. And the
      light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame, and shall burn and shall
      devour his thorns and his briers in one day; and shall consume the glory of his forest, and of
      his fruitful field, both soul and body; and they shall be as when a standard-bearer fainteth.
      And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them. And it
      shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the
      house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the
      Lord, the Holy One of Israel, in truth. The remnant shall return, yea, even the remnant of
      Jacob, unto the mighty God. For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a
      remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness. For
      the Lord God of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in all the land. Therefore
      thus saith the Lord God of hosts, O my people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the
      Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against thee, after the
      manner of Egypt. For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine anger
      in their destruction. And the Lord of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the
      slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb; and as his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it
      up after the manner of Egypt. And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be
      taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be
      destroyed because of the anointing. He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash
      he hath laid up his carriages; they are gone over the passage; they have taken up their
      lodging at Geba; Ramath is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled. Lift up the voice, O daughter of
      Gallim; cause it to be heard unto Laish, O poor Anathoth. Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants
      of Gebim gather themselves to flee. As yet shall he remain at Nob that day; he shall shake his
      hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem. Behold, the Lord, the
      Lord of hosts shall lop the bough with terror; and the high ones of stature shall be hewn
      down, and the haughty shall be humbled. And he shall cut down the thickets of the forests with
      iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one. </text>

      his roots; and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and
      understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of fear of the
      Lord; and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord; and he shall not
      judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears: but with
      righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and
      he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he
      slay the wicked. And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the
      girdle of his reins. The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down
      with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child
      shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down

      shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be

      second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left from Assyria, and from
      Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and
      from the islands of the sea. And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble
      the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of
      the earth. The envy of Ephraim also shall depart and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut
      off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim. But they shall fly upon
      the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together;
      they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them. And
      the Lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and with his mighty wind he
      shall shake his hand over the river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go
      over dry shod. And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be
      left, from Assyria, like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of
      Egypt. </text>

    <text> The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see. Lift ye up a banner upon the
      high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of
      the nobles. I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones, for mine
      anger is not upon them that rejoice in my highness. The noise of the multitude in the
      mountains like as of a great people; a tumultous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered
      together: the Lord of hosts mustereth the hosts of the battle. They come from a far country,
      from the end of heaven, yea, the Lord, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the
      whole land. Howl ye; for the day of the Lord is at hand: it shall come as a destruction from
      the Almighty. Therefore shall all hands be faint, every man's heart shall melt; and they shall
      be afraid; pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be amazed one at another;
      their faces shall be as flames.-- Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath
      and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of
      it. For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light; and the
      sun be darkened in her going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. And I
      will punish the world for evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; I will cause the arrogancy
      of the proud to cease, and will lay down the haughtiness of the terrible. I will make a man
      more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir. Therefore I will
      shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place in the wrath of the Lord of
      hosts, and in the days of his fierce anger. And it shall be as the chaste roe, and as a sheep
      that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into
      his own land. Every one that is proud shall be thrust through; yea, and every one that is
      joined to the wicked, shall fall by the sword. Their children also shall be dashed to pieces
      before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished. Behold, I will
      stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver and gold, nor they shall not
      delight in it. Their bows shall also dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity
      on the fruit of the womb; their eyes shall not spare children. And Babylon, the glory of
      kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and
      Gomorrah. It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to
      generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there: neither shall the shepherds make their
      fold there: but wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of
      doleful creatures, and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there. And the wild
      beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant
      palaces: and her time is near to come, and her day shall not be prolonged. For I will destroy
      her speedily; yea, for I will be merciful unto my people: but the wicked shall perish. </text>

    <text> For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their
      own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house of
      Jacob. And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: yea, from far unto the
      ends of the earth: and they shall return to their lands of promise. And the house of Israel
      shall possess them, and the land of the Lord shall be for servants and handmaids: and they
      shall take them captives, unto whom they were captives; and they shall rule over their
      oppressors. And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall give thee rest from thy
      sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve. And it
      shall come to pass in that day, that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of
      Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased, the golden city ceased! The Lord hath broken
      the staff of the wicked, the sceptres of the rulers. He who smote the people in wrath with a
      continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth. The
      whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing. Yea, the fir-trees
      rejoice at thee, and also the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller
      is come up against us. Hell from beneath moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming: it
      stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth: it hath raised up from
      their thrones all the kings of the nations. All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou
      also become weak as we? Art thou become like unto us? Thy pomp is brought down to the grave;
      the noise of thy viols is not heard: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.
      How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! Art thou cut down to the
      ground, which did weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend into
      heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the
      congregation, in the sides of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will
      be like the Most High. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. They
      that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and shall consider thee, and shall say, Is this
      the man that made the earth to tremble, and did shake kingdoms, and made the world as a
      wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof, and opened not the house of his prisoners? All
      the kings of the nations, yea, all of them, lie in glory, every one of them in his own house.
      But thou are cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and the remnant of those that
      are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcass
      trodden under feet. Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed
      thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of evil-doers shall never be renowned. Prepare
      slaughter for his children for the iniquities of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor
      possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.-- For I will rise up against
      them, saith the Lord of hosts, and cut off from Babylon the name and remnant, and son, and
      nephew, saith the Lord. I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water:
      and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the Lord of hosts. The Lord of hosts
      hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have
      purposed, so shall it stand: that I will bring the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains
      tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off
      their shoulders. This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and this is the
      hand that is stretched out upon all nations. For the Lord of hosts hath purposed, and who
      shall disannul? And his hand stretched out, and who shall turn it back? In the year that king
      Ahaz died was this burden. Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that
      smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his
      fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent. And the first-born of the poor shall feed, and the
      needy shall lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy
      remnant. Howl, O gate; cry O city; thou, whole Palestina, art dissolved: for there shall come
      from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his appointed times. What shall then answer
      the messengers of the nations? That the Lord hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people
      shall trust in it. </text>

    <text> Now I, Nephi, do speak somewhat concerning the words which I have written, which have
      been spoken by the mouth of Isaiah. For behold, Isaiah spake many things which were hard for
      many of my people to understand: for they know not concerning the manner of prophesying among
      the Jews. For I, Nephi, have not taught them many things concerning the manner of the Jews;
      for their works were works of darkness, and their doings were doings of abominations.
      Wherefore, I write unto my people, unto all they that shall receive hereafter these things
      which I write, that they may know the judgments of God, that they come upon all nations.
      according to the word which he hath spoken. --Wherefore hearken, O my people, which are of the
      House of Israel, and give ear unto my words: for because that the words of Isaiah are not
      plain unto you, nevertheless they are plain unto all they that are filled with the spirit of
      prophecy. But I give unto you a prophecy, according to the spirit which is in me; wherefore I
      shall prophesy according to the plainness which hath been with me from the time that I came
      out from Jerusalem with my father: for behold, my soul delighteth in plainness unto my people,
      that they may learn; yea, and my soul delighteth in the words of Isaiah, for I came out from
      Jerusalem, and mine eyes hath beheld the things of the Jews, and I know that the Jews do
      understand the things of the Prophets, and there is none other people that understand the
      things which were spoken unto the Jews, like unto them, save it be that they are taught after
      the manner of the things of the Jews. But behold, I, Nephi, have not taught my children after
      the manner of the Jews; but behold, I, of myself, have dwelt at Jerusalem, wherefore I know
      concerning the regions round about; and I have made mention unto my children concerning the
      judgments of God, which hath come to pass among the Jews, unto my children, according to all
      that which Isaiah hath spoken, and I do not write them. But behold, I proceed with mine own
      prophecy, according to my plainness; in the which, I know that no man can err; nevertheless,
      in the days that the prophecies of Isaiah shall be fulfilled, men shall know of a surety, at
      the times when they shall come to pass; wherefore, they are of worth unto the children of men,
      and he that supposeth that they are not, unto them will I speak particularly, and confine the
      words unto mine own people: for I know that they shall be of great worth unto them on the last
      days; for in that day shall they understand them; wherefore, for their good have I written
      them. And as one generation hath been destroyed among the Jews, because of iniquity, even so
      have they been destroyed, from generation to generation, according to their iniquities; and
      never hath any of them been destroyed, save it were foretold them by the Prophets of the Lord.
      Wherefore, it hath been told them concerning the destruction which should come upon them,
      immediately after my father left Jerusalem; nevertheless, they hardened their hearts; and
      according to my prophecy, they have been destroyed, save it be those which are carried away
      captive into Babylon. And now this I speak because of the spirit which is in me. And
      notwithstanding that they have been carried away, they shall return again, and possess the
      land of Jerusalem; wherefore they shall be restored again to the lands of their inheritance.
      But, behold, they shall have wars, and rumors of wars; and when the day cometh that the only
      begotten of the Father, yea, even the Father of heaven and of earth, shall manifest himself
      unto them in the flesh, behold, they will reject him, because of their iniquities, and the
      hardness of their hearts, and the stiffness of their necks. Behold they will crucify him, and
      after that he is laid in a Sepulcher for the space of three days, he shall rise from the dead,
      with healing in his wings, and all they that shall believe on his name, shall be saved in the
      Kingdom of God; wherefore, my soul delighted to prophesy concerning him, for I have seen his
      day, and my heart doth magnify his holy name. And behold it shall come to pass, that after the
      Messiah hath risen from the dead, and hath manifested himself unto his people, unto as many as
      will believe on his name, behold, Jerusalem shall be destroyed again: for wo unto them that
      fight against God and the people of his church. Wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered among
      all nations, yea, and also Babylon shall be destroyed; wherefore, the Jews shall, be scattered
      by other nations; and after that they have been scattered, and the Lord God hath scourged them
      by other nations, for the space of many generations, yea, even down from generation to
      generation, until they shall be persuaded to believe in Christ, the Son of God, and the
      atonement, which is infinite for all mankind; and when that day shall come, that they shall
      believe in Christ, and worship the father in his name, with pure hearts, and clean hands, and
      look not foreward any more for another Messiah, then, at that time the day will come that it
      must needs be expedient that they should believe these things, and the Lord will set his hand
      again the second time to restore his people from their lost and fallen state. Wherefore, he
      will proceed to do a marvelous work, and a wonder among the children of men. Wherefore, he
      shall bring forth his words unto them, which words shall judge them at the last day, for they
      shall be given them for the purpose of convincing them of the true Messiah, who was rejected
      by them; and unto the convincing of them that they need not look forward for a Messiah to
      come, for there should not any come, save it should be a false Messiah, which should deceive
      the people: for there is save one Messiah spoken of by the Prophets, and that Messiah is he
      which should be rejected by the Jews. For according to the words of the Prophets, the Messiah
      cometh in six hundred years from the time my father left Jerusalem; and according to the words
      of the Prophets, and also the word of the Angel of God, his name shall be Jesus Christ the Son
      of God. And now my brethren, I have spoken plain, that ye cannot err; and as the Lord liveth,
      that brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and gave unto Moses power that he should heal
      the nations, after that they had been bitten by the poisonous serpents, if they would cast
      their eyes unto the serpent which he did raise up before them , and also gave him power that
      he should smite the rock, and the water should come forth; yea, behold I say unto you, that as
      these things are true, and as the Lord God liveth, there is none other name given under
      heaven, save it be this Jesus Christ of which I have spoken, whereby man can be saved.
      Wherefore, for this cause hath the Lord God promised unto me that these things which I write,
      shall be kept and preserved, and handed down unto my seed, from generation to generation, that
      the promise may be fulfilled unto Joseph, that his seed should never perish as long as the
      earth should stand. Wherefore, these things shall go from generation to generation, as long as
      the earth shall stand; and they shall go according to the will and pleasure of God; and the
      nations shall possess them, shall be judged of them according to the words which are written;
      for we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe
      in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved,
      after all that we can do. And notwithstanding we believe in Christ, we keep the law of Moses,
      and look forward with steadfastness unto Christ, until the law shall be fulfilled; for, for
      this end was the law given; wherefore, the law hath become of our faith; yet we keep the law
      because of the commandments; and we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ,
      we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to
      what source they may look for a remission of their sins. Wherefore, we speak concerning the
      law that our children may know the deadness of the law; and they, by knowing the deadness of
      the law, may look forward unto that life which is in Christ, and know for what end the law was
      given. And after that, the law is fulfilled in Christ, that they need not harden their hearts
      against him, when the law had ought to be done away. And now behold, my people, ye are a
      stiffnecked people; wherefore, I have spoken plain unto you, that ye cannot misunderstand. And
      the words which I have spoken, shall stand as a testimony against you: for they are sufficient
      to teach any man the right way; for the right way is to believe in Christ and deny him not;
      for by denying him, ye also deny the Prophets and the law. And now behold I say unto you, that
      the right way is to believe in Christ, and deny him not; and Christ is the Holy One of Israel:
      wherefore ye must bow down before him and worship him with all your might, mind, and strength,
      and your whole soul; and if ye do this, ye shall in nowise be cast out. And inasmuch as it
      shall be expedient, ye must keep the performances and ordinances of God, until the law shall
      be fulfilled which was given unto Moses. </text>

    <text> And after that Christ shall have risen from the dead, he shall shew himself unto you, my
      children, and my beloved brethren; and the words which he shall speak unto you, shall be the
      law which ye shall do. For behold, I say unto you, that I have beheld that many generations
      shall pass away, and there shall be great wars and contentions among my people. And after that
      the Messiah shall come, there shall be signs given unto my people of his birth, and also of
      his death and resurrection; and great and terrible shall that day be unto the wicked; for they
      shall perish; and they perish because they cast out the prophets, and the saints, and stone
      them, and slay them: wherefore the cry of the blood of the saints shall ascend up to God from
      the ground, against them. Wherefore all they that are proud, and that do wickedly, the day
      that cometh shall burn them up saith the Lord of Hosts, for they shall be as stubble; and they
      that kill the prophets, and the saints, the depths of the earth shall swallow them up, saith
      the Lord of Hosts; and mountains shall cover them, and whirlwinds shall carry them away, and
      buildings shall fall upon them, and crush them to pieces, and grind them to powder; and they
      shall be visited with thunderings, and lightnings, and earthquakes, and all manner of
      destruction, for the fire of the anger of the Lord shall be kindled against them, and they
      shall be as stubble, and the day that cometh shall consume them, saith the Lord of Hosts. O
      the pain and the anguish of my soul for the loss of the slain of my people! For I, Nephi, hath
      seen it, and it well nigh consumeth me before the presence of the Lord; but I must cry unto my
      God, thy ways are just. But behold, the righteous, that hearken unto the words of the
      Prophets, and destroy them not, but look forward unto Christ with steadfastness for the signs
      which are given, notwithstanding all persecutions; behold they are which shall not perish. But
      the Son of righteousness shall appear unto them; and he shall heal them, and they shall have
      peace with him, until three generations shall have passed away, and many of the fourth
      generation shall have passed away in the righteous. --And when these things shall have passed
      away, a speedy destruction cometh unto, my people; for, notwithstanding the pains of my soul,
      I have seen it; wherefore, I know that it shall come to pass; and they sell themselves for
      nought; for, for the reward of their pride, and their foolishness, they shall reap
      destruction; for because they yieldeth unto the Devil, and choose works of darkness rather
      than light; therefore they must go down to hell, for the spirit of the Lord will not always
      strive with man. And when the spirit ceaseth to strive with man, then cometh speedy
      destruction; and this grieveth my soul. And I spake concerning the convincing of the Jews,
      that Jesus is the very Christ, it must needs be, that the Gentiles be convinced also, that
      Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God; and that he manifesteth himself unto all they that
      believe in him, by the power of the Holy Ghost; yea, unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and
      people, working mighty miracles, signs and wonders, among the children of men, according to
      their faith. But behold I prophesy unto you concerning the days when the Lord God shall bring
      these things forth unto the children of men. After that my seed and the seed of my brethren
      shall have dwindled in unbelief, and shall have been smitten by the Gentiles; yea, after that
      the Lord God shall have camped against them round about, and shall have laid siege against
      them with a mount, and raised forts against them; and after that they shall have been brought
      down low into the dust, even that they are not, yet the words of the righteous shall be
      written, and the prayers of the faithful shall be heard, and all they which have dwindled in
      unbelief, shall not be forgotten; for they which shall be destroyed shall speak unto them out
      of the ground, and their speech shall be low out of the dust, and their voice shall be as one
      that hath a familiar spirit; for the Lord God will give unto him power, that he may whisper
      concerning them, even as it were out of the ground; and their speech shall whisper out of the
      dust. For thus saith the Lord God: They shall write the things which shall be done among them,
      and they shall be written and sealed up in a book, and they that have dwindled in unbelief,
      shall not have them, for they seek to destroy the things of God: wherfore, as they which have
      been destroyed, have been destroyed speedily; and the multitude of their terrible ones, shall
      be as chaff that passeth away. Yea, thus saith the Lord God: It shall be at an instant,
      suddenly. And it shall come to pass, that they which have dwindled in unbelief, shall be
      smitten by the hand of the Gentiles. And the Gentiles are lifted up in the pride of their
      eyes, and have stumbled, because of the greatness of their stumbling block, that they have
      built up many churches; nevertheless they put down the power and the miracles of God, and
      preach up unto themselves, their own wisdom, and their own learning, that they may get gain,
      and grind upon the face of the poor; and there are many churches built up which causeth
      envyings, and strifes, and malice; and there are also secret combinations, even as in times of
      old, according to the combinations of the Devil, for he is the founder of all these things;
      yea, the founder of murder, and works of darkness; yea, and he leadeth them by the neck with a
      flaxen cord, until he bindeth them with his strong cords forever. For behold, my beloved
      brethren, I say unto you, that the Lord God worketh not in darkness. He doeth not anything,
      save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his
      own life, that he may draw all men unto him. Wherefore, he commandeth none that they shall not
      partake of his salvation. Behold, doth he cry unto any, saying, Depart from me? Behold, I say
      unto you, nay; but he saith, Come unto me all ye ends of the earth, buy milk and honey,
      without money, and without price. Behold, hath he commanded any that they should depart out of
      the synagogues, or out of the houses of worship? Behold, I say unto you, nay. Hath he
      commanded any that they should not partake of his salvation? Behold, I say unto you, nay; but
      he hath given it free for all men; and he hath commanded his people that they should persuade
      all men unto repentance. Behold, hath the Lord commanded any that they should not partake of
      his goodness? Behold, I say unto you, nay; but all men are privileged the one like unto the
      other, and none are forbidden. He commandeth that there shall be no priest-crafts; for,
      behold, the priest-crafts are that men preach and set themselves up for a light unto the
      world; that they may get gain, and praise of the world; but they seek not the welfare of Zion.
      Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing; wherefore, the Lord God hath given a commandment,
      that all men should have charity, which charity is love. And except they should have charity,
      they were nothing: wherefore, if they should have charity, they would not suffer the laborer
      in Zion to perish. But the laborer in Zion, shall labor for Zion; for if they labor for money,
      they shall perish. And again, the Lord God hath commanded that men should not murder; that
      they should not lie; that they should not steal; that they should not take the name of the
      Lord their God in vain; that they should not envy; that they should not have malice; that they
      should not contend one with another; that they should not commit whoredoms; and that they
      should do none of these things; for whoso doeth them, shall perish; for none of these
      iniquities come of the Lord; for he doeth that which is good among the children of men; and he
      doeth nothing save it be plain unto the children of men; and he inviteth them all to come unto
      him, and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white,
      bond and free, male and female, and he remembereth the heathen, and all alike unto God, both
      Jew and Gentile. </text>

    <text> But, behold, in the last days, or in the days of the Gentiles; yea, behold all the
      nations of the Gentiles, and also the Jews, both they which shall come upon this land, and
      they which shall be upon other lands; yea, even upon all the lands of the earth; behold, they
      will be drunken with iniquity, and all manner of abominations; and when that day shall come,
      they shall be visited of the Lord of hosts, with thunder and with earthquake, and with a great
      noise, and with storm and tempest, and with the flame of devouring fire; and all the nations
      that fight against Zion, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision; yea, it
      shall be unto them, even as unto a hungry man, which dreameth, and behold he eateth, but he
      awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto a thirsty man, which dreameth, and behold he
      drinketh, but he awaketh, and behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite; yea, even so
      shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against mount Zion: for behold, all ye
      that do iniquity, stay yourselves and wonder, for ye shall cry out, and cry; ,yea, ye shall be
      drunken, but not with wine; ye shall stagger, but not with strong drink: for behold, the Lord
      hath poured out upon you, the spirit of deep sleep. For behold, ye have closed your eyes, and
      ye have rejected the Prophets, and your rulers, and the seers hath he covered because of your
      iniquities. And it shall come to pass, that the Lord God shall bring forth unto you, the words
      of a book, and they shall be the words of them which have slumbered. And behold, the book
      shall be sealed; and in the book shall be a revelation from God, from the beginning of the
      world, to the ending thereof. Wherefore, because of the things which are sealed up, the things
      which are sealed, shall not be delivered in the day of the wickedness and abominations of the
      people. Wherefore the book shall be kept from them. But the book shall be delivered unto a
      Man, and he shall deliver the words of the book, which are the words of they which have
      slumbered in the dust; and he shall deliver these words unto another; but the words which are
      sealed, he shall not deliver, neither shall he deliver the book. For the book shall be sealed
      by the power of God, and the revelation which was sealed, shall be kept in the book until the
      own due time of the Lord, that they may come forth: for, behold, they reveal all things from
      the foundation of the world, unto the end thereof. And the day cometh that the words of the
      book which were sealed, shall be read upon the house-tops; and they shall be read by the power
      of Christ: and all things shall be revealed unto the children of men which ever hath been
      among the children of men, and which ever will be, even unto the end of the earth. Wherefore,
      at that day when the book shall be delivered unto the man of whom I have spoken, the book
      shall be hid from the eyes of the world, that the eyes of none shall behold it, save it be
      that three witnesses shall behold it, by the power of God, besides him to whom the book shall
      be delivered; and they shall testify to the truth of the book, and the things therein. And
      there is none other which shall view it, save it be a few, according to the will of God, to
      bear testimony of his word unto the children of men: for the Lord God hath said, that the
      words of the faithful should speak as if it were from the dead.Wherefore, the Lord God will
      proceed to bring forth the words of the book, and in the mouth of as many witnesses as seemeth
      him good, will he establish his word: and wo be unto him that rejecteth the word of God. But
      behold, it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall say unto him to whom he shall deliver
      the book. Take these words which are not sealed, and deliver them to another, that he may shew
      them unto the learned, saying: Read this, I pray thee. And the learned shall say, Bring hither
      the book, and I will read them: and now, because of the glory of the world, and to get gain,
      will they say this, and not for the glory of God. And the man shall say, I cannot bring the
      book, for it is sealed. Then shall the learned say, I cannot read it. Wherefore, it shall come
      to pass, that the Lord God will deliver again the book and the words thereof, to him that is
      not learned; and the man that is not learned, shall say, I am not learned. Then shall the Lord
      say unto him, The learned shall not read them, for they have rejected them, and I am able to
      do mine own work; wherefore, thou shalt read the words which I shall give unto thee. Touch not
      the things which sealed, for I will bring them forth in mine own due time: for I will shew
      unto the children of men, that I am able to do mine own work. Wherefore, when thou hast read
      the words which I have commanded thee, and obtained the witnesses which I have promised unto
      thee, then shalt thou seal up the book again, and hide it up unto me, that I may preserve the
      words which thou hast not read, until I shall see fit in mine own wisdom, to reveal all things
      unto the children of men. For behold, I am God; and I am a God of miracles; and I will shew
      unto the world that I am the same yesterday, to-day, and forever; and I work not among the
      children of men, save it be according to their faith. And again it shall come to pass, that
      the Lord shall say unto him that shall read the words that shall be delivered him, For asmuch
      as this people draw near unto me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have
      removed their hearts far from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the precepts of men,
      therefore, I will proceed to do marvellous work among this people; yea, a marvellous work, and
      a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise and learned shall perish, and the understanding of
      their prudent shall be hid. And wo unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the
      Lord. And their works are in the dark; and they say, Who seeth us; and who knoweth us? And
      they also say, Surely, your turning of things upside down, shall be esteemed as the potter's
      clay. But behold, I will shew unto them, saith the Lord of Hosts, that I know all their works.
      For shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? Or, shall the thing framed say of
      him that framed it, He had no understanding? But behold, saith the Lord of hosts, I will shew
      unto the children of men, that it is yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into
      a fruitful field; and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest. And in that day shall
      the deaf hear the words of the book; and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and
      out of darkness; and the meek also shall increase, and their joy shall be in the Lord; and the
      poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. For assuredly as the Lord liveth, they
      shall see that the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all
      that watch for the iniquity are cut off: and they that a make a man an offender for a word,
      and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of
      nought. Therefore thus saith the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob,
      Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale. But when he seeth his
      children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify
      the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel. They also that erred in spirit shall
      come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine. </text>

    <text> And now, behold, my brethren, I have spoken unto you, according as the spirit hath
      constrained me; wherefore, I know that they must surely come to pass. The things which shall
      be written out of the book shall be of great worth unto the children of men, and especially
      unto our seed, which is a remnant of the house of Israel. For it shall come to pass in that
      day, that the churches which are built up, and not unto, the Lord, when the one shall say unto
      the other, Behold, I, I am the Lord's; and the other shall say, I, I am the Lord's. And thus
      shall every one say, that hath built up the churches, and not unto the Lord; and they shall
      contend one with another; and their priests shall contend one with another; and they shall
      teach with their learning, and deny the Holy Ghost, which giveth utterance. And they deny the
      power of God, the Holy One of Israel; and they say unto the people, Hearken unto us, and hear
      ye our precept: for behold, there is no God to-day, for the Lord and the Redeemer hath done
      his work, and he hath given his power unto men. Behold, hearken ye unto my precept: if they
      shall say there is a miracle wrought, by the hand of the Lord, believe it not; for this day he
      is not a God of miracles: he hath done his work. Yea, and there shall be many which shall say,
      eat, drink, and be merry, for to-morrow we die; and it shall be well with us. And there shall
      also be many which shall say, eat, drink, and be merry; nevertheless, fear God, he will
      justify in committing a little sin; yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one because of
      his words, dig a pit for thy neighbor; there is no harm in this. And do all these things, for
      to-morrow we die; and if it so be that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and
      at last we shall be saved in the Kingdom of God. Yea, and there shall be many which shall
      teach after this manner, false, and vain, and foolish doctrines, and shall be puffed up in
      their hearts, and shall seek deep to hide their counsels from the Lord; and their works shall
      be in the dark; and the blood of the Saints shall cry from the ground against them. Yea, they
      have all gone out of the way; they have become corrupted. Because of pride, and because of
      false teachers, and false doctrine, their churches have become corrupted; and their churches
      are lifted up; because of pride, they are puffed up. They rob the poor, because of their fine
      sanctuaries; they rob the poor, because of their fine clothing; and they persecute the meek,
      and the poor in heart; because of their pride, they are puffed up. They wear stiff necks, and
      high heads; yea, and because of pride, and wickedness, and abominations, and whoredoms, they
      have all gone astray, save it be a few, which are humble followers of Christ; nevertheless,
      they are led, that in many instances they do err, because they are taught by the precepts of
      men. O the wise and the learned, and the rich, that are puffed up in pride of their hearts,
      and all they that preach false doctrines, and all they that commit whoredoms, and pervert the
      right way of the Lord; wo, wo, wo be unto them saith the Lord God Almighty, for they shall be
      thrust down to hell. Wo unto them that turn aside the just for a thing of nought, and revile
      against that which is good, and say that it is no worth: for the day shall come that the Lord
      God will speedily visit the inhabitants of the earth; and in that day that they are fully ripe
      in iniquity, they shall perish. But behold, if the inhabitants of the earth shall repent of
      their wickedness and abominations, they shall not be destroyed, saith the Lord of Hosts. But
      behold, that great and abominable church, the whore of all the earth, must tumble to the
      earth; and great must be the fall thereof: for the kingdom of the Devil must shake, and they
      which belong to it must needs be stirred up unto repentance, or the Devil will grasp them with
      his everlasting chains, and they be stirred up to anger and perish: for behold, at that day
      shall he rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that
      which is good; and others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they
      will say, All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well; and thus the Devil cheateth
      their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell. And behold, others he flattereth
      away, and telleth them there is no hell; and he saith unto the, I am no Devil, for there is
      none: and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from
      whence there is no deliverance.Yea, they are grasped with death and hell; and death, and hell,
      and the Devil, and all that have been seized therewith, must stand before the Throne of God,
      and be judged according to their works, from whence they must go into the place prepared for
      them, even a lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment. Therefore, wo be unto him
      that is at ease in Zion. Wo be unto him that crieth, All is well; yea, wo be unto him that
      hearkeneth unto the precepts of men, and denieth the power of God and the gift of the Holy
      Ghost. Yea, wo be unto him that saith, We have received, and we need no more. And in fine, wo
      unto all they that tremble, and are angry because of the truth of God. For behold, he that is
      built upon the rock, receiveth it with gladness; and he that is built upon a sandy foundation,
      trembleth, lest he shall fall. Wo be unto him that shall say, We have received the word of
      God, and we need no more of the word of God, for we have enough. For behold, thus saith the
      Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a
      little there a little; and blessed are they that hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear
      unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom: for unto him that receiveth, I will give more;
      and them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they
      have. --Cursed is he that putteth his trust in man, or maketh flesh his arm, or shall hearken
      unto the precepts of men, save their precepts shall be given by the power of the Holy Ghost.
      Wo be unto the Gentiles, saith the Lord God of Hosts: for notwithstanding I shall lengthen out
      mine arm unto them from day to day, they shall deny me; nevertheless, I will be merciful unto
      them, saith the Lord God, if they will repent and come unto me: for mine arm is lengthened out
      all the day long, saith the Lord God of Hosts. </text>

    <text> But behold, there shall be many at that day, when I shall proceed to do a marvelous work
      among them, that I may remember my covenants which I have made unto the children of men, that
      I may set my hand again the second time to recover my people, which are of the House of
      Israel; and also, that I may remember the promises which I have made unto thee, Nephi, and
      also unto thy father, That I would remember your seed; and that the words of your seed should
      proceed forth out of my mouth unto your seed. And my words shall hiss forth unto the ends of
      the earth, for a standard unto my people, which are of the House of Israel. And because my
      words shall hiss forth, many of the Gentiles shall say, A Bible, a Bible, we have got a Bible,
      and there cannot be any more Bible. But thus saith the Lord God: O fools, they shall have a
      Bible; and it shall proceed forth from the Jews, mine ancient covenant people. And what thank
      they the Jews for the Bible which they receive from them? Yea, what do the Gentiles mean? Do
      they remember the travels, and labors, and the pains of the Jews, and their diligence unto me,
      in bringing forth salvation unto the Gentiles. O ye Gentiles, have ye remembered the Jews,
      mine ancient covenant people? Nay; but ye have cursed them, and have hated them, and have not
      sought to recover them. But behold, I will return all these things upon your own heads: for I
      the Lord hath not forgotten my people. Thou fool, that shall say a Bible, we have got a Bible,
      and we need no more Bible. Have ye obtained a Bible, save it were by the Jews? Know ye not
      that there are more nations than one? Know ye not that I the Lord your God, have created all
      men, and that I remember they which are upon the isles of the sea; and that I rule in the
      heavens above, and in the earth beneath; and I bring forth my word unto the children of men,
      yea, even upon all the nations of the earth? Wherefore murmur ye, because that ye shall
      receive more of my word? Know ye not that the testimony of two nations is a witness unto you
      that I am God. that I remember one nation like unto another? wherefore, I speak the same words
      unto one nation like unto another. And when the two nations shall run together, the testimony
      of the two nations shall run together also. I do this that I may prove unto many, that I am
      the same yesterday, to-day, and forever; and that I speak forth my words according to mine own
      pleasure. And because that I have spoken one word, ye need not suppose that I cannot speak
      another: for my work is not yet finished; neither shall it be, until the end of man; neither
      from that time henceforth and forever. Wherefore, because that ye have a Bible, ye need not
      suppose that it contains all my words; neither need ye suppose that I have not caused more to
      be written: for I command all men, both in the east, and in the west, and in the north, and in
      the south, and in the islands of the sea, that they shall write the words which I speak unto
      them: for out of the books which shall be written, I will judge the world every man according
      to their works, according to that which is written. --For behold, I shall speak unto the Jews,
      and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the Nephites, and they shall write it;
      and I shall also speak unto the other tribes of the House of Israel, which I have led away,
      and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto all the nations of the earth, and they
      shall write it. And it shall come to pass that the Jews, shall have the words of the Nephites,
      and the Nephites shall have the words of the Jews; and the Nephites and the Jews shall have
      the words of the lost tribes of Israel; and the lost tribes of Israel shall have the words of
      the Nephites and the Jews. And it shall come to pass that my people which are of the House of
      Israel, shall be gathered home unto the lands of their possessions; and my word also shall be
      gathered in one. And I will shew them that fight against my word and against my people, which
      are of the House of Israel, that I am God, and that I covenanted with Abraham that I would
      remember his seed forever. </text>

    <text> And now, behold, my beloved brethren, I would speak unto you: for I, Nephi, would not
      suffer, that ye should suppose that ye are more righteous than the Gentiles shall be. For
      behold, except ye shall keep the commandments of God, ye shall all likewise perish; and
      because of the words which have been spoken, ye need not suppose that the gentiles are utterly
      destroyed. For behold, I say unto you, as many of the Gentiles as will repent, are the
      covenant people of the Lord; and as many of the Jews as will not repent, shall be cast off:
      for the Lord covenanteth with none, save it be with them that repent and believe in his Son,
      which is the Holy One of Israel. And now, I would prophesy somewhat more concerning the Jews
      and the Gentiles. For after the book of which I have spoken shall come forth, and be written
      unto the Gentiles, and sealed up again unto the Lord, there shall be many which shall believe
      the words which are written; and they shall carry them forth unto the remnant of our seed. And
      then shall the remnant of our seed know concerning us, how that we came out from Jerusalem,
      and that they are a descendant of the Jews. And the Gospel of Jesus Christ shall be declared
      among them; wherefore, they shall be restored unto the knowledge of their fathers, and also to
      the knowledge of Jesus Christ, which was had among their fathers. And then shall they rejoice,
      for they shall know that it is a blessing unto them from the hand of God; and their scales of
      darkness shall begin to fall from their eyes; and many generations shall not pass away among
      them, save they shall be a white and a delightsome people. And it shall come to pass that the
      Jews are scattered, also shall begin to believe in Christ; and they shall begin to gather in
      upon the face of the land; and as many as shall believe in Christ, shall also become a
      delightsome people. And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall commence his work, among
      all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, to bring about the restoration of his people upon
      the earth. And with righteousness shall the Lord God judge the poor, and reprove with equity,
      for the meek of the earth. And he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with
      the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked: for the time speedily cometh, that the Lord
      God shall cause a great division among the people; and the wicked will he destroy; and he will
      spare his people, yea, even if it so be that he must destroy the wicked by fire. And
      righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins. And
      then shall the wolf dwell with the lamb. and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the
      calf, and the young lion, and the fatling, together; and a little child shall lead them. And
      the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall
      eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned
      child shall put his hand on the cockatrice's den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my
      holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the
      sea. Wherefore, the things of all nations shall be made known; yea, all things shall be made
      known unto the children of men. There is nothing which is secret, save it shall be revealed;
      there is no works of darkness, save it shall be made manifest in the light; and there is
      nothing which is sealed upon the earth, save it shall be loosed. Wherefore, all things which
      have been revealed unto the children of men, shall at that day be revealed; and Satan shall
      have power over the hearts of the children of men no more, for a long time. And now, my
      beloved brethren, I must make an end of my sayings. </text>

    <text> And now, I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying unto you, my beloved brethren. And I
      cannot write but a few things, which I know must surely come to pass; neither can I write but
      a few words of my brother Jacob. Wherefore, the things which I have written, sufficeth me,
      save it be a few words which I must speak, concerning the doctrine of Christ; wherefore, I
      shall speak unto you plainly, according to the plainness of my prophesying. For my soul
      delighteth in plainness: for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of
      men. For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding: for he speaketh unto men according
      to their language, unto their understanding. Wherefore, I would that ye remember that I have
      spoken unto you, concerning that Prophet which the Lord showed unto me, that should baptize
      the Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of the world. And now, if the Lamb of God, he
      being holy, should have need to be baptized by water, to fulfil righteousness, O then, how
      much more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water. And now, I would ask
      of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb of God did fulfil all righteousness in being
      baptized by water? Know ye not that he was holy? But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth
      unto the children of men, that according to the flesh, he humbleth himself before the Father,
      and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments;
      wherefore, after that he was baptized with water, the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the
      form of a dove. And again: it sheweth unto the children of men the straightness of the path,
      and the narrowness of the gate, by which they should enter, he having set the example before
      them. And he saith unto the children of men, Follow thou me. Wherefore, my beloved brethren,
      can we follow Jesus, save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father? And the
      Father saith, Repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in the name of my beloved Son. And also,
      the voice of the Son came unto me saying, He that is baptized in my name, to him will the
      Father give the Holy Ghost, like unto me; wherefore, follow me, and do the things which ye
      have seen me do. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with
      full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent,
      repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the
      name of Christ, by baptism; yea, by following your Lord and Saviour down into the water,
      according to his word; behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the
      baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak with the tongues of Angels, and
      shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel. But behold, my beloved brethren, thus came the
      voice of the Son unto me, saying, After that ye have repented of your sins, and witnessed unto
      the Father that ye are willing to keep my commandments, by the baptism of water, and have
      received the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and can speak with a new tongue, yea, even
      with the tongue of Angels, and after this, should deny me, it would have been better for you,
      that ye had not known me. And I heard a voice from the Father, saying, Yea, the words of my
      beloved, are true and faithful. He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved. And now,
      my beloved brethren, I know by this, that unless a man endure to the end, in following the
      example of the Son of the living God, he cannot be saved; wherefore, do the things which I
      have told you that I have seen, that your Lord and your Redeemer should do: for, for this
      cause have they been shown unto me, that ye might know the gate by which ye should enter. For
      the gate by which ye should enter, is repentance, and baptism by water; and then cometh a
      remission of your sins by fire, and by the Holy Ghost. And then are ye in this straight and
      narrow path which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate: ye have done
      according to the commandments of the Father and the Son; and ye have received the Holy Ghost,
      which witness of the Father and the Son, unto the fulfilling of the promise which he hath
      made. That if ye entered in by the way, ye should receive. And now, my beloved brethren, after
      that ye have got into this straight and narrow path, I would ask, If all is done? Behold, I
      say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far, save it were by the word of Christ, with
      unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of Him who is mighty to save; wherefore,
      ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and
      a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of
      Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life. And
      now, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under
      heaven, whereby man can be saved in the Kingdom of God. And now, behold, this is the doctrine
      of Christ, and the only true doctrine of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,
      which is in God, without end. Amen. </text>

    <text> And now, behold, my beloved brethren, I suppose that ye ponder somewhat in your hearts,
      concerning that which ye should do, after that ye have entered in by the way. But behold, why
      do ye ponder these things in your hearts? Do ye not remember that I said unto you, that after
      ye had received the Holy Ghost, ye could speak with the tongue of Angels? And now, how could
      ye speak with the tongue of Angels, save it were by the Holy Ghost? Angels speak by the power
      of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ. --Wherefore, I said unto you,
      feast upon the words of Christ: for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what
      ye should do. Wherefore, now after that I have spoken these words, if ye cannot understand
      them, it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye knock; wherefore, ye are not brought into
      the light, but must perish in the dark. For behold, again I say unto you, that if ye will
      enter in by the way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will shew unto you all things what ye
      should do. Behold, this is the doctrine of Christ; and there will be no more doctrine given,
      until after that he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh. And when he shall manifest
      himself unto you in the flesh, the things which he shall say unto you, shall ye observe to do.
      And now I, Nephi, cannot say more: the spirit stoppeth mine utterance, and I am left to mourn
      because of the unbelief, and the wickedness, and the ignorance, and the stiff-neckedness of
      men: for they will not search knowledge, nor understand great knowledge, when it is given unto
      them in plainness, even as plain as word can be. And now my beloved brethren, I perceive that
      ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing.
      For if ye would hearken unto the spirit which teacheth a man to pray, ye would know that ye
      must pray: for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not
      pray. But behold, I say unto you, that ye must pray always, and not faint; that ye must not
      perform any thing unto the Lord, save in the first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the
      name of Christ, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that thy performance may be
      for the welfare of thy soul. </text>

    <text> And now I, Nephi, cannot write all the things which were taught among my people; neither
      am I mighty in writing, like unto speaking: for when a man speaketh by the power of the holy
      Ghost , the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men. But
      behold, there are many that harden their hearts against the Holy Spirit, that it hath no place
      in them; wherefore, they cast many things away which are written, and esteem them as things of
      nought. But I, Nephi, have written what I have written; and I esteem it as of great worth, and
      especially unto my people. For I pray continually for them by day, and mine eyes water my
      pillow by night, because of them; and I cry unto my God in faith, and I know that he will hear
      my cry; and I know that the Lord God will consecrate my prayers, for the gain of my people.
      And the things which I have written in weakness, will be made strong unto them: for it
      persuadeth them to do good; it maketh known unto them of their fathers; and it speaketh of
      Jesus, and persuadeth men to believe in him, and to endure to the end, which is life eternal.
      And it speaketh harsh against sin, according to the plainness of the truth; wherefore, no man
      will be angry at the words which I have written, save he shall be of the spirit of the Devil.
      I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in my Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul from
      hell. I have charity for my people, and great faith in Christ, that I shall meet many souls
      spotless at his judgment seat. I have charity for the Jew; I say Jew, because I mean them from
      whence I came. I also have charity for the Gentiles. --But behold, for none of these I cannot
      hope, except they shall be reconciled unto Christ, and enter into the narrow gate, and walk in
      the straight path, which leads to life, and continue in the path until the end of the day of
      probation. And now, my beloved brethren, and also Jew, and all ye ends of the earth, hearken
      unto these words, and believe in Christ; and if ye believe not in these words, believe in
      Christ. And if ye shall believe in Christ, ye will believe in these words: for they are the
      words of Christ, and he hath given them unto me; and they teach all men that they should do
      good. And if they are not the words of Christ, judge ye: for Christ will shew unto you, with
      power and great glory, that they are his words, at the last day; and you and I shall stand
      face to face before his bar; and ye shall know that I have been commanded of him to write
      these things, notwithstanding my weakness: And I pray the Father in the name of Christ, that
      many of us, if not all, may be saved in his kingdom, at the great and last day. And now, my
      beloved brethren, all they which are of the House of Israel, and all ye ends of the earth, I
      speak unto you, as the voice of one crying from the dust: farewell until that great day shall
      come; and you that will not partake of the goodness of God, and respect the words of the Jews,
      and also my words, and the words which shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the Lamb of
      God, behold, I bid you an everlasting farewell, for these words shall condemn you at the last
      day: for what I seal on earth, shall be brought against you at the judgment bar; for thus hath
      the Lord commanded me, and I must obey. Amen. </text>

    <text> For behold, it came to pass that fifty and five years had passed away, from the time that
      Lehi left Jerusalem; wherefore, Nephi gave me, Jacob, a commandment concerning the small
      plates, upon which these things are engraven. And he gave me, Jacob, a commandment that I
      should write upon these plates, a few of the things which I considered to be most precious:
      that I should not touch, save it were lightly, concerning the history of this people which are
      called the people of Nephi. For he said that the history of his people should be engraven upon
      his other plates, and that I should preserve these plates, and hand them down unto my seed,
      from generation to generation. And if there were preaching which was sacred, or revelation
      which was great, or prophesying, that I should engraven the heads of them upon these plates,
      and touch upon them as much as it were possible, for Christ's sake, and for the sake of our
      people: for because of faith and great anxiety, it truly had been made manifest unto us
      concerning our people, what things should happen unto them. And we also had many revelations,
      and the spirit of much prophecy; wherefore, we knew of Christ and his Kingdom, should come.
      Wherefore, we laboured diligently among our people, that we might persuade them to come unto
      Christ, and partake of the goodness of God, that they might enter into his rest, lest by means
      he should swear in his wrath they should not enter in, as in the provocation in the days of
      temptation, while the children of Israel were in the wilderness. --Wherefore, we would to God
      that we could persuade all men not to rebel against God, to provoke him to anger, but that all
      men would believe in Christ, and view his death, and suffer his cross, and bear the shame of
      the world; wherefore, I, Jacob, take it upon me to fulfil the commandment of my brother Nephi.
      Now Nephi began to be old, and he saw that he must soon die; wherefore, he anointed a man to
      be a king and a ruler over his people now, according to the reigns of the kings. --The people
      having loved Nephi exceedingly, he having been a great protector for them, having wielded the
      sword of Laban in their defence, and having laboured in all his days for their welfare;
      wherefore, the people were desirous to retain in remembrance his name. And whoso should reign
      in his stead, were called by the people Second Nephi, Third Nephi, &amp;c. according to
      the reigns of the kings; and thus they were called by the people, let them be of whatever name
      they would. And it came to pass that Nephi died. Now the people which were not Lamanites, were
      Nephites; nevertheless, they were called Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites, Zoramites,
      Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites. But I, Jacob, shall not hereafter distinguish them by
      these names, but I shall call them Lamanites. They that seek to destroy the people of Nephi,
      and they which are friendly to Nephi, I shall call Nephites, or the people of Nephi, according
      to the reigns of the kings. And now it came to pass that the people of Nephi, under the reign
      of the second king, began to grow hard in their hearts, and indulge themselves somewhat in
      wicked practices, such as like unto David of Old, desiring many wives and concubines, and also
      Solomon, his son; yea, and they also began to search much gold and silver, and began to be
      lifted up somewhat in pride; wherefore, I, Jacob, gave unto them these words as I taught them
      in the temple, having firstly obtained mine errand from the Lord. For I, Jacob, and my brother
      Joseph, had been consecrated priests, and teachers of this people, by the hand of Nephi. And
      we did magnify our office unto the Lord, taking upon us the responsibility, answering the sins
      of the people upon our own heads, if we did not teach them the word of God with all diligence;
      wherefore, by laboring with our mights, their blood might not come upon our garments, and we
      would not be found spotless at the last day. </text>

    <text> The words which Jacob, the brother of Nephi, spake unto the people of Nephi, after the
      death of Nephi: Now my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, according to the responsibility which I am
      under to God, to magnify mine office with soberness, and that I might rid my garments of your
      sins, I come up into the temple this day, that I might declare unto you the word of God; and
      ye yourselves know, that I have hitherto been diligent in the office of my calling; but I this
      day am weighed down with much more desire and anxiety for the welfare of your souls, than I
      have hitherto been. For behold, as yet, ye have been obedient unto the word of the Lord, which
      I have given unto you. But behold, hearken ye unto me, and know that by the help of the
      All-powerful Creator of Heaven and Earth, I can tell you concerning your thoughts, how that ye
      are beginning to labor in sin, which sin appeareth very abominable unto me, yea, and
      abominable unto God. Yea, it grieveth my soul and causeth me to shrink with shame before the
      presence of my Maker, that I might testify unto you concerning the wickedness of your hearts;
      and also, it grieveth me that I must use so much boldness of speech, concerning you, before
      your wives and your children, many of whose feelings are exceeding tender, and chaste, and
      delicate before God, which thing is pleasing unto God; and it supposeth me that they have come
      up hither to hear the pleasing word of God, yea, the word which healeth the wounded soul.
      Wherefore, it burdeneth my soul, that I should be constrained because of the strict
      commandment which I have received from God, to admonish you, according to your crimes, to
      enlarge the wounds of those which are already wounded, instead of consoling and healing and
      their wounds; and those which have not been wounded, instead of feasting upon the pleasing
      word of God, have daggers placed to pierce their souls, and wound their delicate minds. But,
      notwithstanding the greatness of the task, I must do according to the strict commands of God,
      and tell you concerning your wickedness and abominations, in the presence of the pure in
      heart, and the broken heart, and under the glance of the piercing eye of the Almighty God.
      Wherefore, I must tell you the truth, according to the plainness of the word of God. For
      behold, as I inquired of the Lord, thus came the word unto me, saying, Jacob, get thou up into
      the temple on the morrow, and declare the word which I shall give thee, unto this people. And
      now behold, my brethren, this is the word which I declare unto you, that many of you have
      began to search for gold, and for silver, and all manner of precious ores, in the which this
      land, which is a land of promise unto you, and to your seed, doth abound most plentifully. And
      the hands of Providence hath smiled upon you most pleasingly, that you have obtained many
      riches; and because that some of you have obtained more abundantly than that of your brethren,
      ye are lifted up in the pride of your hearts, and wear stiff necks, and high heads, because of
      the costliness of your apparel, and persecute your brethren, because that ye suppose that ye
      are better than they. And now my brethren, do ye suppose that God justifieth you in this
      thing? Behold, I say unto you, Nay. But he condemneth you, and if ye persist in these things,
      his judgments must speedily come unto you. O that he would shew you that he can pierce you,
      and with one glance of his eye, he can smite you to the dust. O that he would rid you from
      this iniquity, and abomination. And, O that ye would listen unto the word of his commands, and
      let not his pride of your hearts destroy your souls. Think of your brethren, like unto
      yourselves, and be familiar with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you. But
      before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the Kingdom of God. And after that ye have obtained a
      hope in Christ, ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye shall seek them, for the
      intent to do good; to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive,
      and administer relief to the sick, and the afflicted. And now my brethren, I have spoken unto
      you concerning pride; and those of you which have afflicted your neighbor, and persecuted him,
      because ye were proud in your hearts, of the things which God hath given you, what say ye of
      it? Do ye not suppose that such things are abominable unto him, and who created all flesh? And
      the one being is as precious in his sight as the other. And all flesh is of dust; and for the
      self same end hath he created them, that they should keep his commandments, and glorify him
      forever. And now I make an end of speaking unto you concerning this pride. And were it not
      that I must speak unto you concerning a grosser crime, my heart would rejoice exceedingly,
      because of you. But the word of God burthens me because of your grosser crimes. For behold,
      thus saith the Lord: This people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the Scriptures:
      for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the things which were
      written concerning David, and Solomon his Son. Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives
      and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord. Wherefore, thus saith
      the Lord: I have led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, by the power of mine arm,
      that I might rise up unto me a righteous branch, from the fruit of the loins of Joseph.
      Wherefore, I the Lord God, will not suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old.
      Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: for there shall not any
      man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none: For I, the Lord
      God, delighteth in the chastity of women. And whoredoms is an abomination before me: thus
      saith the Lord of Hosts. Wherefore, this people shall keep my commandments, saith the Lord of
      Hosts, or cursed be the land for their sakes. For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up
      seed unto me, I will command my people: otherwise, they shall hearken unto these things. For
      behold, I, the Lord, have seen the sorrow, and heard the mourning of the daughters of my
      people, in the land of Jerusalem; yea, and in all the lands of my people, because of the
      wickedness and abominations of their husbands. And I will not suffer, saith the Lord of Hosts,
      that the cries of the fair daughters of this people, which I have led out of the land of
      Jerusalem, shall come up unto me, against the men of my people, saith the Lord of Hosts; for
      they shall not lead away captive, the daughters of my people, because of their tenderness,
      save I shall visit them with a sore curse, even unto destruction: for they shall not commit
      whoredoms, like unto they of old, saith the Lord of Hosts. And now behold, my brethren, ye
      know that these commandments were given to our father Lehi; wherefore, ye have known them
      before; and ye have come unto great condemnation; for ye have done these things, which ye
      ought not have done. Behold, ye have done greater iniquities than the Lamanites, our brethren.
      Ye have broken the hearts of your tender wives, and lost the confidence of your children,
      because of your bad examples before them; and the sobbings of their hearts ascendeth up to God
      against you. And because of the strictness of the word of God, which cometh down against you,
      many hearts died, pierced with deep wounds. </text>

    <text> But behold, I, Jacob, would speak unto you that are pure in heart. Look unto God with
      firmness of mind, and pray unto him with exceeding faith, and he will console you in your
      afflictions, and he will plead your cause, and send down justice upon those who seek your
      destruction. O ye that are pure in heart, lift up your heads and receive the pleasing word of
      God, and feast upon his love; for ye may, if your mind are firm, forever. But, wo, wo, unto
      you that are not pure in heart; that are filthy this day before God; for except ye shall
      repent, the land is cursed for your sakes; and the Lamanites, which are not filthy like unto
      you, (nevertheless, they are cursed with a sore cursing) shall scourge you even unto
      destruction. And the time speedily cometh that except ye repent, they shall possess the land
      of your inheritance, and the Lord God will lead away the righteous out from among you. Behold,
      the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye hate, because of their filthiness and the cursings which
      hath come upon their skins, are more righteous than you: for they have not forgotten the
      commandment of the Lord, which was given unto our fathers, that they should have, save it were
      one wife; and concubines they should have none; and there should not be whoredoms committed
      among them. And now this commandment they observe to keep it; wherefore, because of this
      observance in keeping this commandment. the Lord God will not destroy them, but will be
      merciful unto them; and one day they shall become a blessed people. Behold, their husbands
      love their wives, and their wives love their husbands, and their husbands and their wives love
      their children; and their unbelief and their hatred towards you, is because of the iniquity of
      their fathers; wherefore, how much better are you than they, in the sight of your Great
      Creator? O my brethren, I fear, that unless ye shall repent of your sins, that their skins
      will be whiter than yours, when ye shall be brought with them before the throne of God.
      Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, which is the word of God, that ye revile no more
      against them, because of the darkness of their skins; neither shall ye revile against them
      because of their filthiness; but ye shall remember your own filthiness, and remember that
      their filthiness came because of their fathers. Wherefore, ye shall remember your children,
      how that ye have grieved their hearts, because of the example that ye have set before them;
      and also, remember that ye may, because of your filthiness, bring your children unto
      destruction, and their sins be heaped upon your heads at the last day. O my brethren, hearken
      unto my word; arouse the faculties of your soul; shake yourselves, that ye may awake from the
      slumber of death; and loose yourselves from the pains of hell, that ye may not become the
      Angels to the Devil, to be cast into that lake of fire and brimstone, which is the second
      death. And now I, Jacob, spake many more things unto the people of Nephi, warning them against
      fornications, and lasciviousness, and every kind of sin, telling them the awful consequences
      of them; and a hundredth part of the proceedings of this people, which now began to be
      numerous, cannot be written upon these plates; but many of their proceedings are written upon
      the larger plates, and their wars, and their contentions, and the reigns of their kings. These
      plates are called the plates of Jacob; and they were made by the hand of Nephi. And I make an
      end of speaking these words. </text>

    <text> Now behold it came to pass, that I, Jacob, having ministered much unto my people, in
      word, (and I cannot write but a little of my words because of the difficulty of engraving our
      words upon plates,) and we know that the things which we write upon plates, must remain; but
      whatsoever things we write upon any thing save it be upon plates, must perish and vanish away;
      but we can write a few words upon plates, which will give our children, and also our beloved
      brethren, a small degree of knowledge concerning us, or concerning their fathers. Now in this
      thing we do rejoice; and we labor diligently to engraven these words upon the plates, hoping
      that our beloved brethren, and our children, will receive them with thankful hearts, and look
      upon them, that they may learn with joy, and not with sorrow, neither with contempt,
      concerning their first parents: for, for this intent have we written these things, that they
      may know that we knew of Christ, and we had a hope of his glory, many hundred years before his
      coming; and not only we, ourselves, had a hope of his glory, but also all the Holy Prophets
      which were before us. Behold, they believed in Christ, and worshiped the Father in his name;
      and also, we worshiped the Father in his name. And for this intent, we keep the law of Moses,
      it pointing our souls to him; and for this cause, it is sanctified unto us for righteousness,
      even as it was accounted unto Abraham in the wilderness, to be obedient unto the commands of
      God, in offering up his son Isaac, which was a similitude of God and his only begotten Son.
      Wherefore, we search the Prophets; and we have many revelations, and the spirit of prophecy;
      and having all these witnesses, we obtain a hope, and our faith becometh unshaken, insomuch
      that we truly can command in the name of Jesus, and the very trees obey us, or the mountains,
      or the waves of the sea; nevertheless, the Lord God sheweth us our weakness, that we may know
      that it is by grace, and his great condescentions unto the children of men, that we have power
      to do these things. Behold, great and marvelous are the works of the Lord. --How unsearchable
      are the depths of the mysteries of Him; and it is impossible that man should find out all his
      ways. --And no man knoweth of his ways, save it be revealed unto him; wherefore, brethren,
      despise not the revelations of God. For behold, by the power of his word, man came upon the
      face of the earth; which earth was created by the power of his word. Wherefore, if God, being
      able to speak, and the world was; and to speak, and man was created, O then, why not able to
      command the earth, or the workmanship of his hands upon the face of it, according to his will
      and pleasure. Wherefore, brethren, seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his
      hand. For behold, ye yourselves know, that he counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in
      great mercy, over all his works, wherefore, beloved brethren, be reconciled unto him, through
      the atonement of Christ, his only begotten Son, that ye may obtain a resurrection, according
      to the power of the resurrection which is in Christ, and be presented as the first fruits of
      Christ, unto God, having faith, and obtained a good hope of glory in him, before he
      manifesteth himself in the flesh. And now, beloved, marvel not that I tell you these things;
      for why not speak of the atonement of Christ, and attain to a perfect knowledge of him, as to
      attain to the knowledge of a resurrection and the world to come? Behold, my brethren, he that
      prophesieth, let him prophesy to the understanding of men; for the spirit speaketh the truth,
      and lieth not. Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they really are, and of things as they
      really will be; wherefore, these things are manifested unto us plainly, for the salvation of
      our souls. But behold, we are not witnesses alone in these things; for God also spake them
      unto Prophets of old. But behold, the Jews were a stiffnecked people; and they despised the
      words of plainness, and killed the Prophets, and sought for things that they could not
      understand. Wherefore, because of their blindness, which blindness came by looking beyond the
      mark, they must needs fall: for God hath taken away his plainness from them, and delivered
      unto them many things which they cannot understand, because they desired it. And because they
      desired it, God hath done it, that they may stumble. And now I, Jacob, am led on by the spirit
      unto prophesying: for I perceive the working of the spirit which is in me, that by the
      stumbling of the Jews, they will reject the stone upon which they might build, and have safe
      foundation. But behold, according to the Scriptures, this stone shall become the great, and
      the last, and only sure foundation, upon which the Jews can build. And now, my beloved, how is
      it possible that these, after having rejected the sure foundation, can ever build upon it,
      that it may become the head of their corner? Behold, my beloved brethren, I will unfold this
      mystery, unto you; if I do not, by any means, get shaken from my firmness in the spirit, and
      stumble because of my over anxiety for you. </text>

    <text> Behold, my brethren, do ye not remember to have read the words of the Prophet Zenos,
      which spake unto the House of Israel, saying: Hearken O ye House of Israel, and hear the words
      of me a Prophet of the Lord: for behold, thus saith the Lord, I will liken thee, O House of
      Israel, like unto a tame olive tree, which a man took and nourished in his vineyard; and it
      grew, and waxed old, and began to decay. And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard
      went forth, and he saw that his olive tree began to decay; and he sayeth, I will prune it, and
      dig about it, and nourish it, that perhaps it may shoot forth young and tender branches, and
      it perish not. And it came to pass that he pruned it, and digged about it, and nourished it,
      according to his word. And it came to pass that after many days, it began to put forth
      somewhat a little, young and tender branches; but behold, the main top thereof began to
      perish. And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard saw it, and he sayeth unto his
      servant, It grieveth me that I should lose this tree; wherefore, go and pluck the branches
      from a wild olive tree, and bring them hither unto me; and we will pluck off those main
      branches which are beginning to wither away, and we will cast them into the fire, that they
      may be burned. And behold, saith the Lord of the vineyard, I take away many of these young and
      tender branches, and I will graft them whithersoever I will; and it mattereth not that if it
      so be, that the root of this tree will perish, I may preserve the fruit thereof unto myself;
      wherefore, I will take these young and tender branches, and I will graft them withersoever I
      will. Take thou the branches of the wild olive tree, and graft them in, in the stead thereof;
      and these which I have plucked off, I will cast into the fire, and burn them, that they may
      not cumber the ground of my vineyard. And it came to pass that the servant of the Lord of the
      vineyard, done according to the word of the Lord of the vineyard, and grafted in the branches
      of the wild olive tree. And the Lord of the vineyard caused that it should be digged about,
      and pruned, and nourished, saying unto his servant, It grieveth me that I should lose this
      tree; wherefore, that perhaps I might preserve the roots thereof that they perish not, that I
      might preserve them unto myself, I have done this thing. --Wherefore, go thy way; watch the
      tree, and nourish it, according to my words. And these will I place in the nethermost part of
      my vineyard, whithersoever I will, it mattereth not unto thee; and I do it, that I may
      preserve unto myself the natural branches of the tree; and also, that I may lay up fruit
      thereof, against the season, unto myself: for it grieveth me that I should lose this tree, and
      the fruit thereof. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard went his way, and hid the
      natural branches of the tame olive tree in the nethermost parts of the vineyard; some in one,
      and some in another, according to his will and pleasure. And it came to pass that a long time
      passed away, and the Lord of the vineyard sayeth unto his servant, Come, let us go down into
      the vineyard, that we may labor in the vineyard. And it came to pass that the Lord of the
      vineyard, and also the servant, went down into the vineyard to labor. And it came to pass that
      the servant sayeth unto his master, Behold, look here; behold the tree. And it came to pass
      that the Lord of the vineyard looked and beheld the tree, in the which the wild olive branches
      had been grafted; and it had sprang forth, and began to bear fruit. And he beheld that it was
      good; and the fruit thereof was like unto the natural fruit. --And he sayeth unto the servant,
      Behold, the branches of the wild tree hath taken hold of the moisture of the root thereof,
      that the root thereof hath brought forth much strength; and because of the much strength of
      the root thereof, the wild branches hath brought forth tame fruit: now, if we had not grafted
      in these branches, the tree thereof would have perished. And now, behold, I shall lay up much
      fruit, which the tree thereof hath brought forth; and the fruit thereof I shall lay up,
      against the season unto mine own self. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard
      sayeth unto the servant, Come, let us go to the nethermost part of the vineyard, and behold if
      the natural branches of the tree hath not brought forth much fruit also, that I may lay up of
      the fruit thereof against the season, unto mine own self. And it came to pass that they went
      forth whither the master of the vineyard had hid the natural branches of the tree, and he
      sayeth unto the servant, Behold these: and he beheld the first, that it had brought forth much
      fruit; and he beheld also, that it was good. And he sayeth unto the servant, Take of the fruit
      thereof, and lay it up, against the season, that I may preserve it unto mine own self: for
      behold, sayeth he, This long time I have nourished it, and it hath brought forth much fruit.
      And it came to pass that the servant sayeth unto his master, How comest thou hither to plant
      this tree, or this branch of the tree? for behold, it was the poorest spot in all the land of
      thy vineyard. And the Lord of the vineyard sayeth unto him, Counsel me not: I knew that it was
      a poor spot of ground; wherefore, I said unto thee, I have nourished it this long time; and
      thou beholdest that it hath brought forth much fruit. And it came to pass that the Lord of the
      vineyard sayeth unto his servant, Look hither: behold I have planted another branch of the
      tree also; and thou knowest that this spot of ground was poorer than the first. But, behold
      the tree: I have nourished it this long time, and it hath brought forth much fruit; therefore,
      gather it, and lay it up, against the season, that I may preserve it unto mine own self. And
      it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sayeth again unto his servant, Look hither, and
      behold another branch also, which I have planted: behold that I have nourished it also, and it
      hath brought forth fruit. And he sayeth unto the servant, Look hither, and behold the last:
      behold, this have I planted in a good spot of ground; and I have nourished it this long time,
      and only a part of the tree hath brought forth tame fruit; and the other part of the tree hath
      brought forth wild fruit: behold, I have nourished this tree like unto the others. And it came
      to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sayeth unto the servant, Pluck off the branches that
      have not brought forth good fruit, and cast them into the fire. But behold, the servant sayeth
      unto him, Let us prune it, and dig about it, and nourish it a little longer, that perhaps it
      may bring forth good fruit unto thee, that thou canst lay it up against the season. --And it
      came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard, and the servant of the Lord of the vineyard, did
      nourish all the fruit of the vineyard. And it came to pass that a long time had passed away,
      and the Lord of the vineyard sayeth unto his servant, Come, let us go down to the vineyard,
      that we may labor again in the vineyard. For behold, the time draweth near, and the end soon
      cometh: wherefore, I must lay up fruit, against the season, unto mine own self. And it came to
      pass that the Lord of the vineyard and the servant, went down into the vineyard; and they came
      to the tree whose natural branches had been broken off, and the wild branches had been grafted
      in; and behold, all sorts of fruit did cumber the tree. And it came to pass that the Lord of
      the vineyard did taste of the fruit, every sort according to its number. And the Lord of the
      vineyard saith, Behold, this long time have we nourished this tree, and I have laid up unto
      myself against the season, much fruit. But behold, this time it hath brought forth much fruit,
      and there is none of it which is good. And behold, there are all kinds of bad fruit; and it
      profiteth me nothing, notwithstanding all our labor : and now, it grieveth me that I should
      lose this tree. And the Lord of the vineyard sayeth unto the servant, What shall we do unto
      the tree, that I may preserve again good fruit thereof unto mine own self? And the servant
      sayeth unto his master, Behold, because thou didst graft in the branches of the wild olive
      tree, they have nourished the roots, that they are alive, and they have not perished;
      wherefore, thou beholdest that they are yet good. And it came to pass that the Lord of the
      vineyard sayeth unto his servant, The tree profiteth me nothing; and the roots thereof
      profiteth me nothing, so long as it shall bring forth evil fruit. Nevertheless, I know that
      the roots are good; and for mine own purpose I have preserved them; and because of their much
      strength, they have hitherto brought forth from the wild branches, good fruit. But behold, the
      wild branches have grown, and have overran the roots thereof; and because that the wild
      branches have overcome the roots thereof, it hath brought forth much evil fruit; and because
      that it hath brought forth much evil fruit, thou beholdest that it beggineth to perish: and it
      will soon become ripened, that it may be cast into the fire, except we should do something for
      it to preserve it. And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sayeth, unto his servant,
      Let us go down into the nethermost parts of the vineyard, and behold if the natural branches
      have also brought forth evil fruit. And it came to pass that they went down into the
      nethermost parts of the vineyard. And it came to pass that they beheld that the fruit of the
      natural branches had become corrupt also; yea, the first, and the second, and also the last;
      and they had all become corrupt. And the wild fruit of the last, had overcome that part of the
      tree which brought forth good fruit, even that the branches had withered away and died. And it
      came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard wept, and sayeth unto his servant, What could I
      have done more for my vineyard? Behold, I knew that all the fruit of the vineyard, save it
      were these, had become corrupt. And now, these which have once brought forth good fruit, have
      also become corrupted. And now, all the trees of my vineyard are good for nothing, save it be
      hewn down and cast into the fire. And behold, this last, whose branch hath withered away, I
      did plant in a good spot of ground; yea, even that which was choice unto me, above all other
      parts of the land of my vineyard. And thou beheldest that I also cut down that which cumbered
      this spot of ground, that I might plant this tree in the stead thereof. And thou beheldest
      that a part thereof, brought forth good fruit; and a part thereof, brought forth wild fruit.
      And because that I plucked not the branches thereof, and cast them into the fire, behold, they
      have overcome the good branch, that it hath withered away. And now behold, notwithstanding all
      the care which we have taken of my vineyard, the trees thereof hath become corrupted, that
      they bring forth no good fruit; and these I had hope to preserve, to have laid up the fruit
      thereof, against the season, unto mine own self. But behold, they have become like unto the
      wild olive tree; and they are of no worth, but to be hewn down and cast into the fire: and it
      grieveth me that I should lose them. But what could I have done more in my vineyard? Have I
      slackened mine hand, that I have not nourished it? Nay; I have nourished it, and I have digged
      it, and I have pruned it, and I have dunged it; and I have stretched forth mine hand almost
      all the day long; and the end draweth nigh. And it grieveth me that I should hew down all the
      trees of my vineyard, and cast them into the fire, that they should be burned. Who is it that
      hath corrupted my vineyard? And it came to pass that the servant, sayeth unto his master, Is
      it not the loftiness of thy vineyard? Hath not the branches thereof overcame the roots, which
      are good? And because that the branches have overcame the roots thereof? For behold, they grew
      faster than the strength of the roots thereof, taking strength unto themselves. Behold, I say,
      Is not this the cause that the trees of thy vineyard hath become corrupted? And it came to
      pass that the Lord of the vineyard sayeth unto the servant, Let us go to, and hew down the
      trees of the vineyard, and cast them into the fire, that they shall not cumber the ground of
      my vineyard; for I have done all: what could I have done more for my vineyard? But behold, the
      servant saith unto the Lord of the vineyard, Spare it a little longer. And the Lord saith,
      Yea, I will spare it a little longer: for it grieveth me that I should lose the trees of my
      vineyard. Wherefore, let us take of the branches of these which I have planted in the
      nethermost parts of my vineyard, and let us graft them into the tree from whence they came;
      and let us pluck from the tree, those branches whose fruit is most bitter, and graft in the
      natural branches of the tree, in the stead thereof. And this I will do, that the tree may not
      perish, that perhaps I may preserve unto myself the roots thereof, for mine own purpose. And
      behold, the roots of the natural branches of the tree which I planted whithersoever I would,
      are yet alive; wherefore, that I may preserve them also, for mine own purpose, I will take of
      the branches of this tree, and I will graft them in unto them.. Yea, I will graft in unto them
      the branches of their mother tree, that I may preserve the roots also unto mine own self, that
      when they shall be sufficiently strong, that perhaps they may bring forth good fruit unto me,
      and I may yet have glory in the fruit of my vineyard. And it came to pass that they took from
      the natural tree which had become wild, and grafted in unto the natural trees, which also had
      become wild; and they also took of the natural trees which had become wild, and grafted into
      their mother tree. And the Lord of the vineyard sayeth unto the servant, Pluck not the wild
      branches from the trees, save it be those which are most bitter; and in them ye shall graft,
      according to that which I have said. And we will nourish again the trees of the vineyard, and
      we will trim up the branches thereof; and we will pluck from the trees those branches which
      are ripened that must perish, and cast them into the fire. --And this I do, that perhaps the
      roots thereof may take strength, because of their goodness; and because of the change of the
      branches, that the good may overcome the evil; and because that I have preserved the natural
      branches, and the roots thereof; and that I have grafted in the natural branches again, into
      their mother tree, that perhaps the trees of my vineyard may bring forth again good fruit; and
      that I may have joy again in the fruit of my vineyard; and perhaps that I may rejoice
      exceedingly, that I have preserved the roots and the branches of the first fruit; wherefore,
      go to, and call servants, that we may labor diligently with our mights in the vineyard, that
      we may prepare the way, that I may bring forth again the natural fruit, which natural fruit is
      good, and the most precious above all other fruit. Wherefore, let us go to, and labor with our
      mights, this last time: for behold, the end draweth nigh; and this is for the last time that I
      shall prune my vineyard. Graft in the branches: begin at the last, that they may be first, and
      that the first may be last, and dig about the trees, both old and young, the first and the
      last, and the last and the first, that all may be nourished once again for the last time.
      Wherefore, dig about them, and prune them, and dung them once more, for the last time: for the
      end draweth nigh. And if it so be that these last grafts shall grow, and bring forth the
      natural fruit, then shall ye prepare the way for them, that they may grow; and as they begin
      to grow, ye shall clear away the branches which bring forth bitter fruit, according to the
      strength of the good and the size thereof; and ye shall not clear away the bad thereof, all at
      once, lest the roots thereof should be too strong for the graft, and the graft thereof shall
      perish, and I lose the trees of my vineyard. For it grieveth me that I should lose the trees
      of my vineyard; wherefore, ye shall clear away the bad, according as the good shall grow, that
      the roots and the top may be equal in strength, until the good shall overcome the bad, and the
      bad be hewn down and cast into the fire, that they cumber not the ground of my vineyard; and
      thus will I sweep away the bad out of my vineyard. And the branches of the natural tree, will
      I graft again, into the natural tree; and the branches of the natural tree, will I graft into
      the natural branches of the tree; and thus will I bring them together again, that they shall
      bring forth the natural fruit: and they shall be one. And the bad shall be cast away; yea,
      even out of all the land of my vineyard: for behold, only this once will I prune my vineyard.
      And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sent his servant; and the servant went and
      did as the Lord had commanded him, and brought other servants; and they were few. And the Lord
      of the vineyard saith unto them, Go to, and labor in the vineyard, with your mights. For
      behold, this is the last time that I shall nourish my vineyard: for the end is nigh at hand,
      and the season speedily cometh; and if ye labor with your mights with me, ye shall have joy in
      the fruit which I shall lay unto myself, against the time which will soon come. And it came to
      pass that the servants did go to it, and labor with their mights; and the Lord of the vineyard
      labored also with them: and they did obey the commandments of the Lord of the vineyard, in all
      things. And there began to be the natural fruit again in the vineyard; and the natural
      branches began to grow and thrive exceedingly; and the wild branches began to be plucked off,
      and to be cast away; and they did keep the root and the top thereof, equal, according to the
      strength thereof. And thus they labored with all diligence, according to the commandments of
      the Lord of the vineyard, even until the bad had been cast out of the vineyard, and the Lord
      preserved unto himself, that the trees had become again the natural fruit; and they became
      like unto one body; and the fruit were equal; and the Lord of the vineyard had preserved unto
      himself the natural fruit, which was most precious unto him from the beginning. And it came to
      pass that when the Lord of the vineyard saw that his fruit was good, and that his vineyard was
      no more corrupt, he calleth up his servants and sayeth unto them, Behold, for this last time
      have we nourished my vineyard; and thou beholdest that I have done according to my will; and I
      have preserved the natural fruit that it is good, even like as it was in the beginning; and
      blessed art thou. For because that ye have been diligent in laboring with me in my vineyard,
      and have kept my commandments, and hath brought unto me again the natural fruit, that my
      vineyard is no more corrupt, and the bad is cast away, behold, ye shall have joy with me,
      because of the fruit of my vineyard. For behold, for a long time will I lay up of the fruit of
      my vineyard unto mine own self, against the season, which speedily cometh; and for the last
      time have I nourished my vineyard, and pruned it, and dug about it, and dunged it; wherefore I
      will lay up unto mine own self of the fruit, for a long time, according to that which I have
      spoken. And when the time cometh that evil fruit shall again come into my vineyard, then will
      I cause the good and the bad to be gathered; and the good will I preserve unto myself; and the
      bad will I cast away into its own place. And then cometh the season and the end; and my
      vineyard will I cause to be burned with fire. </text>

    <text> And now, behold, my brethren, as I said unto you that I would prophesy, behold this is my
      prophesy: That the things which this prophet Zenos spake, concerning the House of Israel, in
      the which he likened them unto a tame olive tree, must surely come to pass. And in the day
      that he shall set his hand again the second time to recover his people, is the day, yea, even
      the last time, that the servants of the Lord shall go forth in his power, to nourish and prune
      his vineyard; and after that, the end soon cometh. And how blessed are they who have labored
      diligently in his vineyard; and how cursed are they which shall be cast out into their own
      place! And the world shall be burned with fire. And how merciful is our God unto us: for he
      remembereth the House of Israel, both roots and branches; and he stretches forth his hands
      unto them, all the day long: and they are a stiffnecked, and a gain-saying people; but as many
      as will not harden their hearts, shall be saved in the Kingdom of God. Wherefore, my beloved
      brethren, I beseech of you on words of soberness, that ye would repent, and come with full
      purpose of heart, and cleave unto God as he cleaveth unto you. And while his arm of mercy is
      extended towards you in the light of the day, harden not your hearts. Yea, to-day if ye will
      hear his voice, harden not your hearts: for why will ye die? For behold, after that ye have
      been nourished by the good word of God all the day long, will ye bring forth evil fruit, that
      ye must be hewn down and cast into the fire? Behold, will ye reject these words? Will ye
      reject the words of the Prophets? and will ye reject all the words which have been spoken
      concerning Christ, after that so many have spoken concerning him? and deny the good word of
      Christ, and the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and quench the Holy Spirit? and
      make a mock of the great plan of redemption, which hath been laid for you? Know ye not that if
      ye will do these things, that the power of the redemption and the resurrection which is in
      Christ, will bring you to stand with shame and awful guilt before the bar of God, and
      according to the power of justice? for justice cannot be denied. That ye must go away into
      that lake of fire and brimstone, whose flames are unquenchable, and whose smoke ascendeth up
      forever and ever? which lake of fire and brimstone, is endless torment. O then, my beloved
      brethren, repent ye, and enter in at the straight gate, and continue in the way which is
      narrow, until ye shall obtain eternal life. O be wise: what can I say more? Finally, I bid you
      farewell, until I shall meet you before the pleasing bar of God, which bar striketh the wicked
      with awful dread and fear. --Amen. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that after some years had passed away, there came a man among the
      people of Nephi. whose name was Sherem. And it came to pass that he began to preach among the
      people, and to declare unto them that there should be no Christ. And he preached many things
      which were flattering unto the people; and this he done, that he might overthrow the doctrine
      of Christ.And he labored diligently that he might lead away the hearts of the people, insomuch
      that he did lead away many hearts; and he knowing that I, Jacob, had faith in Christ which
      should come, wherefore, he sought much opportunity that he might come unto me. And he was
      learned, that he had a perfect knowledge of the language of the people; wherefore, he could
      use much flattery, and much power of speech, according to the power of the Devil. And he had
      hoped to shake me from the faith, notwithstanding the many revelations, and the many things
      which I had seen concerning these things: for I truly had seen Angels, and they had ministered
      unto me. And also, I had heard the voice of the Lord speaking unto me in very word, from time
      to time; wherefore, I could not be shaken. And it came to pass that he came unto me; and on
      this wise did he speak unto me saying: Brother Jacob, I have sought much opportunity that I
      might speak unto you: for I have heard and also know, that thou goest about much, preaching
      that which ye call the Gospel, or the doctrine of Christ; and ye have led away much of this
      people, that they pervert the right way of God, and keep not the law of Moses, which is the
      right way; and convert the law of Moses into the worship of a being, which ye say shall come
      many hundred years hence. And now behold, I, Sherem, declare unto you that this is blasphemy;
      for no man knoweth of such things: for he cannot tell of things to come. And after this manner
      did Sherem contend against me. But behold, the Lord God poured in his spirit into my soul,
      insomuch that I did confound him in all his words. And I sayeth unto him, Deniest thou the
      Christ which should come? And he sayeth, if there should be a Christ, I would not deny him; I
      know that there is no Christ, neither hath been, nor never will be. And I sayeth unto him,
      Believest thou the Scriptures? And he sayeth, Yea, And I sayeth unto him, Then ye do not
      understand them; for they truly testify of Christ. Behold, I say unto you, That none of the
      prophets have written, nor prophesied, save they have spoken concerning this Christ. And this
      is not all: it hath been made manifest unto me, for I have heard and seen; and it also hath
      been made manifest unto me by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, I know if there should
      be no atonement made, all mankind must be lost. And it came to pass that he sayeth unto me,
      Shew me a sign by this power of the Holy Ghost, in which ye know so much. And I said unto him,
      What am I, that I should tempt God to shew unto thee a sign, in the thing which thou knowest
      to be true? Yet thou wilt deny it, because thou art of the Devil. Nevertheless, not my will be
      done; but if God shall smite thee, let that be a sign unto thee that he hath power, both in
      Heaven and in Earth; and also, that Christ shall come. And thy will, O Lord, be done, and not
      mine. And it came to pass that when Jacob, had spoken these words, the power of the Lord came
      upon him, insomuch that he fell to the earth. And it came to pass that he was nourished for
      the space of many days. And it came to pass that he sayeth unto the people, Gather together on
      the morrow, for I shall die; wherefore, I desire to speak unto the people before that I shall
      die. And it came to pass that on the morrow, that the multitude were gathered together; and he
      spake plainly unto them, and denied the things which he had taught them; and confessed the
      Christ, and the power of the Holy Ghost, and the ministering of Angels. And he spake plainly
      unto them, that he had been deceived by the power of the Devil. And he spake of hell, and
      eternity, and of eternal punishment. And he sayeth I fear lest I have committed the
      unpardonable sin, for I have lied unto God: for I denied the Christ, and said that I believed
      the Scriptures; and they truly testify of him. And because that I have thus lied unto God, I
      greatly fear lest my case shall be awful; but I confess unto God. And it came to pass that
      when he had said these words, he could say no more; and he gave up the ghost. And when the
      multitude had witnessed that he spake these things as he was about to give up the ghost, they
      were astonished exceedingly; insomuch, that the power of God came down upon them, and they
      were overcome, that they fell to the earth. Now, this thing was pleasing unto me, Jacob; for I
      had requested it of my Father which was in Heaven: for he had heard my cry, and answered my
      prayer. And it came to pass that peace, and the love of God, was restored again among the
      people; and they searched the Scriptures, and hearkened no more to the words of this wicked
      man. And it came to pass that many means were devised, to reclaim and restore the Lamanites,
      to the knowledge of the truth; but it all were vain: for they delighted in wars and
      bloodsheds; and they had an eternal hatred against us, their brethren. And they sought by the
      power of their arms to destroy us continually; wherefore, the people of Nephi did fortify
      against them with their armies, and with all their might, trusting in the God and the rock of
      their salvation; wherefore, they became as yet, conquerors of their enemies. And it came to
      pass that I, Jacob, began to be old; and the record of this people being kept on the other
      plates of Nephi, wherefore, I conclude this record, declaring that I have written according to
      the best of my knowledge, by saying, That the time passed away with us, and also our lives
      passed away, like as it were unto us a dream, we being a lonesome and a solemn people,
      wanderers cast out from Jerusalem; born in tribulation, in the wilderness, and hated of our
      brethren, which caused wars and contentions; wherefore, we did mourn out our days. And I,
      Jacob, saw that I must soon go down to my grave; wherefore, I said unto my son Enos, Take
      these plates. And I told him the things which my brother Nephi had commanded me; and he
      promised obedience unto the commands. And I make an end of my writing upon these plates, which
      writing hath been small; and to the reader I bid farewell, hoping that many of my brethren may
      read my words. Brethren, adieu. </text>

    <text> Behold, it came to pass that I, Enos, knowing my father that he was a just man: for he
      taught me in his language, and also in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. And blessed be
      the name of my God for it. And I will tell you of the wrestle which I had before God, before
      that I received a remission of my sins: behold, I went to hunt beasts in the forest; and the
      words which I had often heard my father speak, concerning eternal life, and the joys of the
      saints, and the words of my father, sunk deep into my heart. And my soul hungered; and I
      kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication, for mine
      own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came, I did still
      raise my voice high, that it reached the heavens. And there came a voice unto me saying, Enos,
      thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed. And I, Enos, knew that god could not
      be; wherefore, my guilt was swept away. And I sayeth, Lord, how is it done? And he sayeth unto
      me, Because of thy faith in Christ, whom thou hast not heard nor seen. And many years passeth
      away, before that he shall manifest himself; wherefore, go to it, thy faith hath made thee
      whole. Now, it came to pass that when I had heard these words, I began to feel a desire for
      the welfare of my brethren, the Nephites; wherefore, I did pour out my whole soul unto God for
      them. And while I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the voice of the Lord came into
      my mind again, saying, I will visit thy brethren, according to their diligence in keeping my
      commandments. I have given unto them this land; and it is a holy land; and I curse it not,
      save it be for the cause of iniquity; wherefore, I will visit thy brethren, according as I
      have said; and their transgressions will I bring down with sorrow upon their own heads. And
      after that I, Enos, had heard these words, my faith began to be unshaken in the Lord; and I
      prayed unto him with many long strugglings for my brethren the Lamanites. And it came to pass,
      that after I had prayed, and labored with all diligence, the Lord said unto me, I will grant
      unto thee according to thy desires, because of thy faith. And now behold, this was the desire
      which I desired of him: That if it should so be, that my people, the Nephites, should fall
      into transgression, and by any means be destroyed, and the Lamanites should not be destroyed.
      that the Lord God would preserve a record of my people, the Nephites; even if it so be, by the
      power of his holy arm, that it might be brought forth, at some future day, unto the Lamanites,
      that perhaps they might be brought unto salvation: for at the present, our struggles were
      vain, in restoring them to the true faith. And they swore in their wrath, that if it were
      possible, they would destroy our records and us, and, also, all the traditions of our fathers.
      Wherefore, I knowing that the Lord God was able to preserve our records, I cried unto him
      continually; for he had said unto me, Whatsoever thing ye shall ask in faith, believing that
      ye shall receive in the name of Christ, ye shall receive it. And I had faith, and I did cry
      unto God, that he would preserve the records; and he covenanted with me that he would bring
      them forth unto the Lamanites, in his own due time. --And I, Enos, knew it would be according
      to the covenant which he had made; wherefore, my soul did rest. And the Lord said unto me, Thy
      fathers have also required of me this thing; and it shall be done unto them according to their
      faith, for their faith was like unto thine. And now it came to pass, that I, Enos, went about
      among the people of Nephi, prophesying of things to come, and testifying of the things which I
      had heard and seen. And I bare record that the people of Nephi did seek diligently to restore
      the Lamanites unto the true faith in God. But our labors were vain; their hatred was fixed,
      and they were led by their evil nature, that they became wild, and ferocious, and a
      blood-thirsty people; full of idolatry, and filthiness, feeding upon beasts of prey, dwelling
      in tents, and wandering about in the wilderness, with a short skin girded about their loins,
      and their heads shaven; and their skill was in the bow, and the cimeter, and the axe. --And
      many of them did eat nothing save it was raw meat; and they were continually seeking to
      destroy us. And it came to pass that the people of Nephi did till the land, and raise all
      manner of grain, and of fruit, and flocks of herds, and flocks of all manner of cattle, of
      every kind, and goats, and wild goats, and also much horses. And there were exceeding many
      prophets among us. And the people were a stiff-necked people, hard to understand. And there
      was nothing save it was exceeding harshness, preaching, and prophesying of wars, and
      contentions, and destructions, and continually reminding them of death, and the duration of
      eternity, and the judgments and the power of God; and all these things stirring them up
      continually, to keep them in the fear of the Lord. I say there was nothing short of these
      things, and exceeding great plainness of speech, would keep them from going down speedily to
      destruction. And after this manner do I write concerning them. And I saw wars between the
      Nephites and the Lamanites, in the course of my days. And it came to pass that I began to be
      old, and an hundred and seventy and nine years had passed away from the time that our father
      Lehi left Jerusalem. And as I saw that I must soon go down to my grave, having been wrought
      upon by the power of God, that I must preach and prophesy unto this people, and declare the
      word according to the truth, which is in Christ. And I have declared it in all my days, and
      have rejoiced in it, above that of the world. And I soon go to the place of my rest, which is
      with my Redeemer; for I know that in him I shall rest: I rejoice in the day when my mortal
      shall put on immortality, and shall stand before him: then I shall see his face with pleasure,
      and he will say unto me, Come unto me ye blessed, there is a place prepared for you in the
      mansions of my Father. Amen. </text>

    <text> Now behold, I, Jarom, write a few words, according to the commandment of my father Enos,
      that our genealogy may be kept. And as these plates are small, and as these things are written
      for the intent of the benefit of our brethren, the Lamanites, wherefore, it must needs be that
      I write a little; but I shall not write the things of my prophesying, nor of my relations. For
      what could I write more than my fathers have written? For have not they revealed the plan of
      salvation? I say unto you, Yea; and this sufficeth me. Behold, it is expedient that much
      should be done among this people, because of the hardness of their hearts, and the deafness of
      their ears, and the blindness of their minds, and the stiffness of their necks; nevertheless,
      God is exceeding merciful unto them, and hath not as yet swept them off from the face of the
      land. And there are many among us which have many revelations: for they are not all
      stiffnecked. And as many as are not stiffnecked, and have faith, have communion with the Holy
      Spirit, which maketh manifest unto the children of men, according to their faith. And now,
      behold, two hundred years had passed away, and the people of Nephi had waxed strong in the
      land. They observed to keep the law of Moses, and the Sabbath day Holy unto the Lord. And they
      profaned not; neither did they blaspheme. And the laws of the land were exceeding strict. And
      they were scattered upon much of the face of the land; and the Lamanites also. And they were
      exceeding more numerous than were they of the Nephites; and they loved murder, and would drink
      the blood of beasts. And it came to pass that they came many times against us, the Nephites,
      to battle. But our kings and our leaders were mighty men in the faith of the Lord; and they
      taught the people the ways of the Lord; wherefore, we withstood the Lamanites, and swept them
      away out of our lands, and began to fortify our cities, or whatsoever place of our
      inheritance. And we multiplied exceedingly, and spread upon the face of the land, and became
      exceeding rich in gold, and in silver, and in precious things, and in fine workmanship of
      wood, in building, and in machinery, and also in iron, and copper, and brass, and steel,
      making all manner of tools of every kind to till the ground, and weapons of war; yea, the
      sharp pointed arrow, and the quiver, and the dart, and the javelin, and all preparations for
      war; and thus being prepared to meet the Lamanites, they did not prosper against us. But the
      word of the Lord was verified, which he spake unto our fathers, saying, That inasmuch as ye
      will keep my commandments, ye shall prosper in the land. And it came to pass that the prophets
      of the Lord did threaten the people of Nephi, according to the word of God, that if they did
      not keep the commandments, but should fall into transgression, they should be destroyed from
      off the face of the land; wherefore, the prophets, and the priests, and the teachers, did
      labor diligently, exhorting, with all long suffering, the people to diligence; teaching the
      law of Moses, and the intent for which it was given; persuading them to look forward unto the
      Messiah, and believe in him to come, as though he already was. And after this manner did they
      teach them. And it came to pass that by so doing, they kept them from being destroyed upon the
      face of the land: for they did prick their hearts with the word, continually stirring them up
      unto repentance. And it came to pass that two hundred and thirty and eight years had passed
      away, after the manner of wars, and contentions, and dissentions, for the space of much of the
      time. And I, Jarom, do not write more, for the plates are small. --But behold, my brethren, ye
      can go to the other plates of Nephi: for behold, upon them the record of our wars are
      engraven, according to the writings of kings, or that which they caused to be written. And I
      deliver these plates into the hands of my son Omni, that they may be kept according to the
      commandments of my fathers. </text>

    <text> Behold, it came to pass that I, Omni, being commanded by my father Jarom, that I should
      write somewhat upon these plates, to preserve our genealogy; wherefore, in my days, I would
      that ye should know that I fought much with the sword, to preserve my people, the Nephites,
      from falling into the hands of their enemies, the Lamanites. But behold I, of myself, am a
      wicked man; and I have not kept the statutes and the commandments of the Lord, as I ought to
      have done. And it came to pass that two hundred and seventy and six years had passed away, and
      we had many seasons of peace; and we had many seasons of serious war and bloodshed. --Yea, and
      in fine, two hundred and eighty and two years had passed away, and I kept these plates
      according to the commandments of my fathers; and I conferred them upon my son Amaron. And I
      make an end. And now I, Amaron, write these things whatsoever I write, which are few, in the
      book of my father. Behold, it came to pass that three hundred and twenty years had passed
      away, and the more wicked part of the Nephites were destroyed: for the Lord would not suffer,
      after he had led them out of the land of Jerusalem, and kept and preserved them from falling
      into the hands of their enemies; yea, he would not suffer that the words should not be
      verified, which he spake unto our fathers, saying, That inasmuch as ye will not keep my
      commandments, ye shall not prosper in the land. Wherefore, the Lord did visit them in great
      judgment; nevertheless, he did spare the righteous, that they should not perish, but did
      deliver them out of the hands of their enemies. And it came to pass that I did deliver the
      plates unto my brother Chemish. Now I, Chemish, write what few things I write, in the same
      book with my brother: for behold, I saw the last which he wrote, that he wrote it with his own
      hand; and he wrote it in the day that he delivered them unto me. And after this manner we keep
      the records: for it is according to the commandments of our fathers. And I make an end.
      Behold, I, Abinadom, I am the son of Chemish. Behold, it came to pass that I saw much war and
      contention between my people, the Nephites, and the Lamanites; and I, with mine own sword,
      have taken the lives of many of the Lamanites, in the defence of my brethren. And behold, the
      record of this people is engraven upon the plates which is had by the kings, according to the
      generations; and I know of no revelations, save that which has been written, neither prophecy;
      wherefore, that which is sufficient, is written. And I make an end. Behold, I am Amaleki, the
      son of Abinadom. Behold, I will speak unto you somewhat concerning Mosiah, which was made king
      over the land of Zarahemla: for behold, he being warned of the Lord that he should flee out of
      the land of Nephi, and as many as would hearken unto the voice of the Lord, should also depart
      out of the land with him, into the wilderness. And it came to pass that he did according as
      the Lord had commanded him. And they departed out of the land into the wilderness, as many as
      would hearken unto the voice of the Lord; and they were led by many preachings and
      prophesyings. And they were admonished continually by the word of God; and they were led by
      the power of his arm, through the wilderness, until they came down into the land which is
      called the land of Zarahemla. And they discovered a people which was called the people of
      Zarahemla. Now, there was great rejoicing among the people of Zarahemla; and also, Zarahemla
      did rejoice exceedingly, because that the Lord had sent the people of Mosiah with the plates
      of brass which contained the record of the Jews. Behold, it came to pass that Mosiah
      discovered that the people of Zarahemla, came out from Jerusalem, at the time that Zedekiah,
      king of Judah, was carried away captive into Babylon. And they journied in the wilderness, and
      was brought by the hand of the Lord, across the great waters, into the land where Mosiah
      discovered them; and they had dwelt there from that time forth. And at the time that Mosiah
      discovered them, they had become exceeding numerous. Nevertheless. they had had many wars and
      serious contentions, and had fallen by the sword from time to time; and their language had
      become corrupted; and they had brought no records with them; and they denied the being of
      their Creator, and Mosiah, nor the people of Mosiah, could not understand them. But it came to
      pass that Mosiah caused that they should be taught in his language. And it came to pass that
      after they were taught in the language of Mosiah, Zarahemla gave a genealogy of his fathers,
      according to his memory: and they are written, but not in these plates. And it came to pass
      that the people of Zarahemla, and of Mosiah did unite together; and Mosiah was appointed to be
      their king. And it came to pass in the days of Mosiah, there was a large stone brought unto
      him, with engravings on it; and he did interpret the engravings, by the gift and power of God.
      And they gave an account of one Coriantumr, and the slain of his people. And Coriantumr was
      discovered by the people of Zarahemla; and he dwelt with them for the space of nine Moons. It
      also spake a few words concerning his fathers. And his first parents came out from the Tower,
      at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people; and the severity of the Lord fell
      upon them, according to his judgments, which is just; and their bones lay scattered in the
      land northward. Behold, I, Amaleki, was born in the days of Mosiah; and I have lived to see
      his death; and Benjamin, his son, reigneth in his stead. And behold, I have seen in the days
      of the king Benjamin, a serious war, and much bloodshed, between the Nephites and the
      Lamanites. But behold, the Nephites did obtain much advantage over them; yea, insomuch that
      king Benjamin did drive them out of the land of Zarahemla. And it came to pass that I began to
      be old; and, having no seed, and knowing king Benjamin to be a just man before the Lord,
      wherefore, I shall deliver up these plates unto him, exhorting all men to come unto God, the
      Holy One of Israel, and believe in prophesying, and in revelations, and in the ministering of
      Angels, and in the gift of speaking with tongues, and in the gift of interpreting languages in
      all things which is good: for there is nothing which is good, save it come from the Lord; and
      that which is evil, cometh from the Devil. And now my beloved brethren, I would that ye should
      come unto Christ, which is the Holy One of Israel, and partake of his salvation, and the power
      of his redemption. Yea, come unto him, and offer your whole souls as an offering unto him, and
      continue in fasting and praying, and endure to the end; and as the Lord liveth, ye will be
      saved. And now, I would speak somewhat concerning a certain number which went up into the
      wilderness, to return to the land of Nephi: for there was a large number which were desirous
      to possess the land of their inheritance; wherefore, they went up into the wilderness. And
      their leader being a strong and mighty man, and a stiffnecked man, wherefore, he caused a
      contention among them; and they were all slain, save fifty, in the wilderness, and they
      returned again to the land of Zarahemla. And it came to pass that they also took others, to a
      considerable number, and took their journey again into the wilderness. And, I, Amaleki, had a
      brother, which also went with them; and I have, not since known concerning them. And I am
      about to lay down in my grave; and these plates are full. And I make an end of my speaking.

    <text> And now I, Mormon, being about to deliver up the record which I have been making, into
      the hands of my son Moroni, behold, I have witnessed almost all the destruction of my people,
      the Nephites. And it is many hundred years after the coming of Christ, that I deliver these
      records into the hands of my son; and it supposeth me that he will witness the entire
      destruction of my people. But may God grant that he may survive them, that he may write
      somewhat concerning them, and somewhat concerning Christ, that perhaps some day it may profit
      them. And now, I speak somewhat concerning that which I have written: for after that I had
      made an abridgment from the plates of Nephi, down to the reign of this king Benjamin, of which
      Amaleki spake, I searched among the records which had been delivered into my hands, and I
      found these plates. which contained this small account of the Prophets, from Jacob, down to
      the reign of this king Benjamin; and also many of the words of Nephi. And the things which are
      upon these plates pleasing me, because of the prophecies of the coming of Christ; and my
      fathers knowing that many of them have been fulfilled, yea, and I also know that as many
      things as have been prophesied concerning us down to this day, has been fulfilled; and as many
      as go beyond this day. must surely come to pass; wherefore, I chose these things, to finish my
      record upon them, which remainder of my record I shall take from the plates of Nephi; and I
      cannot write a hundredth part of the things of my people. But behold, I shall take these
      plates, which contain these prophecying and revelations, and put them with the remainder of my
      record, for they are choice unto me; and I know they will be choice unto my brethren. And I do
      this for a wise purpose; for thus it whispereth me, according to the workings of the spirit of
      the Lord which is in me. And now, I do not know all things; but the Lord knoweth all things
      which is to come; wherefore, he worketh in me to do according to his will. And my prayer to
      God, is concerning my brethren, that they may once again come to the knowledge of God; yea,
      the redemption of Christ; that they may once again be a delightsome people. And now I, Mormon,
      proceed to finish out my record, which I take from the plates of Nephi; and I make it
      according to the knowledge and the understanding which God hath given me. Wherefore, it came
      to pass that after Amaleki had delivered up these plates into the hands of king Benjamin, he
      took them and put them with the other plates, which contained records which had been handed
      down by the kings, from generation to generation, until the days of king Benjamin; and they
      were handed down from king Benjamin, from generation to generation, until they have fallen
      into my hands. And I, Mormon, pray to God that they may be preserved, from this time hence
      forth. And I know that they will be preserved: for there are great things written upon them
      out of which my people and their brethren, shall be judged at the great and last day,
      according to the word of God which is written. And now, concerning this king Benjamin: He had
      somewhat contentions among his own people. And it came to pass also, that the armies of the
      Lamanites came down out of the land of Nephi, to battle against his people. But behold, king
      Benjamin gathered together his armies, and he did stand against them; and he did fight with
      strength of his own arm, with the sword of Laban; and in the strength of the Lord they did
      contend against their enemies, until they had slain many thousands of Lamanites. And it came
      to pass that they did contend against the Lamanites, until they had driven them out of all the
      lands of their inheritance. And it came to pass that after there had been a false Christs, and
      their mouths had been shut, and they punished according to their crimes; and after there had
      been false prophets, and false preachers, and teachers among the people, and all these having
      been punished according to their crimes; and after there having been much contentions and many
      dissentions, away unto the Lamanites, behold, it came to pass that king Benjamin, with the
      assistance of the Holy Prophets which were among his people: for behold, king Benjamin was a
      holy man, and he did reign over his people in righteousness. And there were many holy men in
      the land; and they did speak the word of God, with power and with authority; and they did use
      much sharpness, because of the stiffneckedness of the people; wherefore, with the help of
      these, king Benjamin, by laboring with all the might of his body and the faculty of his whole
      soul and also the prophets, wherefore, they did once more establish peace in the land. </text>

    <text> And now there was no more contention in all the land of Zarahemla, among all the people
      which belonged to king Benjamin, so that king Benjamin had continual peace all the remainder
      of his days. And it came to pass that he had three sons; and he called their names Mosiah, and
      Helorum, and Helaman. And he caused that they should be taught in all the language of his
      fathers, that thereby they might become men of understanding; and that they might know
      concerning the prophecies, which had been spoken by the mouths of their fathers, which was
      delivered them by the hand of the Lord. --And he also taught them concerning the records which
      were engraven on the plates of brass, saying, My sons, I would that ye should remember, that
      were it not for these plates, which contain these records and these commandments, we must have
      suffered in ignorance, even at the present time, not knowing the mysteries of God: for it were
      not possible that our father Lehi could have remembered all these things, to have taught them
      to his children, except it were for the help of these plates: for he having been taught in the
      language of the Egyptians, therefore he could read these engravings, and teach them to his
      children, that thereby they could teach them to their children, and so fulfilling the
      commandments of God, even down to the present time. I say unto you, my sons, were it not for
      these things, which have been kept and preserved by the hand of God, that we might read and
      understand of his mysteries, and have his commandments always before our eyes, that even our
      fathers would have dwindled in unbelief, and we should have been like unto our brethren, the
      Lamanites, which know nothing concerning these things, or even do not believe in them when
      they are taught them, because of the traditions of their fathers, which are not correct. O my
      sons, I would that ye should remember that these sayings are true; and also, that these
      records are true. And behold, also the plates of Nephi, which contain the records and the
      sayings of our fathers, from the time they left Jerusalem, until now; and they are true; and
      we can no of their surety, because we have them before our eyes. And now, my sons, I would
      that ye should remember to search them diligently, that ye may profit thereby; and I would
      that ye should keep the commandments of God, that ye may prosper in the land, according to the
      promises which the Lord made unto our fathers. And many more things did king Benjamin teach
      his sons, which are not written in this book. And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had
      made an end of teachings his sons, that he waxed old; and he saw that he must very soon go the
      way of all the earth; therefore, he though it expedient that he should confer the kingdom upon
      one of his sons. Therefore, he had Mosiah brought before him; and these are the words he spake
      unto him, saying: My son, I would that ye should make a proclamation throughout all this land,
      among all this people, or the people of Zarahemla, and the people of Mosiah, which dwell in
      the land, that thereby they may be gathered together: for on the morrow, I shall proclaim unto
      this my people, out of mine own mouth, that thou art a king, and a ruler over this people,
      which the Lord our God hath given us. And moreover, I shall give this people a name, that
      thereby they may be distinguised above all the people which the Lord God hath brought out of
      the land of Jerusalem; and this I do, because they have been a diligent people in keeping the
      commandments of the Lord.-- And I give unto them a name, that never shall be blotted out,
      except it be through transgression. Yea, and moreover I say unto you, That if this highly
      favored people of the Lord should fall into transgression, and become a wicked and an
      adulterous people, that the Lord will deliver them up, that thereby they become weak, like
      unto their brethren; and he will no more preserve them, by his matchless and marvelous power,
      as he hath hitherto preserved our fathers. For I say unto you that if he had not extended his
      arm in the preservation of our fathers, they must have fallen into the hands of the Lamanites,
      and become victims to their hatred. And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had made an
      end of these sayings to his son, that he gave them charge concerning all the affairs of the
      kingdom. And moreover, he also gave him charge concerning the records which were engraven on
      the plates of brass; and also, the plates of Nephi; and also, the sword of Laban, and the ball
      or director, which led our fathers through the wilderness, which was prepared by the hand of
      the Lord, that thereby they might be led, every one according to the heed and diligence which
      they gave unto him. Therefore, as they were unfaithful, they did not prosper nor progress in
      their journey, but were driven back, and incurred the displeasure of God upon them; and
      therefore, they were smitten with famine and sore afflictions, to stir them up in remembrance
      of their duty. And now, it came to pass that Mosiah went and did as his father commanded him,
      and proclaimed unto all the people which were in the land of Zarahemla, that thereby they
      might gather themselves together, to go up to the temple, to hear the words which his father
      should speak unto them. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that after Mosiah had done as his father had commanded him, and had
      made a proclamation throughout all the land, that the people gathered themselves together
      throughout all the land, that they might go up to the temple to hear the words which king
      Benjamin should speak unto them. And there were a great number, even so many that they did not
      number them; for they had multiplied exceedingly, and waxed great in the land. And they also
      took of the firstlings of their flocks, that they might offer sacrifice and burnt offerings,
      according to the law of Moses; and also, that they might give thanks to the Lord their God,
      who had brought them out of the Land of Jerusalem, and who had delivered them out of the hands
      of their enemies, and had appointed just men to be their teachers; and also, a just man to be
      their king, who had established peace in the land of Zarahemla, and who had taught them to
      keep the commandments of God, that they might rejoice, and be filled with love towards God,
      and all men. And it came to pass that when they came up to the temple, they pitched their
      tents round about, every man according to his family, consisting of his wife, and his son, and
      his daughters, and their sons, and their daughters, from the eldest down to the youngest,
      every family being separate, one from another; and they pitched their tents round about the
      temple, every man having his tent with the door thereof towards the temple, that thereby they
      might remain in their tents, and hear the words which king Benjamin should speak unto them;
      for the multitude being so great, that king Benjamin could not teach them all within the walls
      of the temple; therefore, he caused a tower to be erected, that thereby his people might hear
      the words which he should speak unto them. And it came to pass that he began to speak to his
      people from the tower; and they could not all hear his words, because of the greatness of the
      multitude; therefore, he caused that the words he spake, should be written and sent forth
      among those that were not under the sound of his voice, that they might also receive his
      words. And these are the words which he spake and caused to be written, saying: My brethren,
      all ye that have assembled yourselves together, you that can hear my words which I shall speak
      unto you this day: for I have not commanded you to come up hither, to trifle with the words,
      which I shall speak, but that you should hearken unto me, and open your ears that ye may hear,
      and your hearts that ye may understand, and your minds that the mysteries of God may be
      unfolded to your view. I have not commanded you to come up hither, that ye should fear me, or
      that ye should think that I, of myself, am more than a mortal man; but I am like as
      yourselves, subject to all manner of infirmities in body and mind; yet, as I have been chosen
      by this people, and was consecrated by my father, and was suffered by the hand of the Lord
      that I should be a ruler, and a king over this people; and have been kept and preserved by his
      matchless power, to serve thee with all the might, mind, and strength which the Lord hath
      granted unto me; I say unto you, that as I have been suffered to spend my days in your
      service, even up to this time, and have not sought gold nor silver, nor no manner of riches of
      you; neither have I suffered that ye should be confined in dungeons, nor that ye should make
      slaves one to another, or that ye should murder, or plunder, or steal, or commit adultery, or
      even I have not suffered that ye should commit any manner of wickedness, and have taught you
      that ye should keep the commandments of the Lord, in all things which he hath commanded you;
      and even I, myself, have labored with mine own hands, that I might serve you, and that ye
      should not be laden with taxes, and that there should nothing come upon you, which was
      grievous to be borne; and all of these things which I have spoken, ye yourselves are witnesses
      this day. Yet, my brethren, I have not done these things that I might boast, neither do I tell
      these things that thereby I might accuse you; but I tell you these things, that ye may know
      that I can answer a clear conscience before God this day. Behold, I say unto you, that because
      I said unto you that I had spent my days in your service, I do not desire to boast, for I have
      only been in the service of God. And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom;
      that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings, ye are only in the
      service of your God. Behold, ye have called me your king; and if I, whom ye call your king, do
      labor to serve you, then had not ye ought to labor to serve one another? And behold, if I, who
      ye call your king, who has spent his days in your service, and yet hath been in the service of
      God, doth merit any thanks from you, O how had you ought to thank your heavenly King! I say
      unto you, my brethren, that if you should render all the thanks and praise which your whole
      souls hath power to possess, to that God who hath created you, and hath kept and preserved
      you, and hath caused that ye should rejoice, and hath granted that ye should live in peace one
      with another; I say unto you, that if ye should serve him who hath created you from the
      beginning, and art preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live and
      move, and do according to your own will, and even supporting you from one moment to another; I
      say, if ye should serve him with all your whole soul, and yet ye would be unprofitable
      servants. And behold, all that he requires of you, is to keep his commandments; and he hath
      promised you that if ye would keep his commandments, ye should prosper in the land; and he
      never doth vary from that which he hath said; therefore, if ye do keep his commandments, he
      doth bless you, and prosper you. And now in the first place, he hath created you, and granted
      unto you your lives, for which ye are indebted unto him. And secondly: He doth require that ye
      should do as he hath commanded you, for which if ye do, he doth immediately bless you; and
      therefore, he hath paid you. And ye are still indebted unto him; and will be, forever and
      ever; therefore, of what have ye to boast? And now I ask, Can ye say aught of yourselves? I
      answer Nay. Ye cannot say that thou art even as much as the dust of the earth; yet thou was
      created of the dust of the earth: but behold, it belongeth to him who created you. And I, even
      I, whom ye call your king, am no better than ye yourselves are; for I am also of the dust. And
      thou beholdest that I am old, and am about to yield up this mortal frame to its mother earth;
      therefore, as I said unto you that I had served you, walking with a clear conscience before
      God, even so I at this time have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I
      might be found blameless, and that your blood should not come upon me, when I shall stand to
      be judged of God of the things whereof he hath commanded me concerning you. I say unto you,
      that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I might rid my garments
      of your blood, at this period of time when I am about to go down to my grave, that I might go
      down in peace, and my immortal spirit may join the choirs above in singing the praises of a
      just God. And moreover, I say unto you, that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves
      together, that I might declare unto you that I can no longer be your teacher, nor your king,
      for even at this time, my whole frame doth tremble exceedingly, while attempting to speak unto
      you; but the Lord God doth support me, and hath suffered me that I should speak unto you, and
      hath commanded me that I should declare unto you this day, that my son Mosiah, is a king and
      ruler over you. And now, my brethren, I would that ye should do as ye hath hitherto done. As
      ye have kept my commandments, and also the commandments of my father, and have prospered and
      have been kept from falling into the hands of your enemies, even so if ye shall keep the
      commandments of my son, or the commandments of God, which shall be delivered unto you by him,
      ye shall prosper in the land, and your enemies shall have no power over you. But O my people,
      beware lest there shall arise contentions among you, and ye list to obey the evil spirit,
      which was spoken of by my father Mosiah. For behold, there is a wo pronounced upon him who
      listeth to obey that spirit; for if he listeth to obey him, and remaineth and dieth in his
      sins, the same drinketh damnation to his own soul; for he receiveth for his wages an
      everlasting punishment, having transgressed the law of God, contrary to his own knowledge. I
      say unto you, that there are not one among you, except it be your little children, that have
      not been taught concerning these things; but what knoweth that ye are eternally indebted to
      your Heavenly Father, to render to him all that you have, and are, and also have been taught,
      concerning the records which contain the prophecies which have been spoken by the Holy
      Prophets, even down to the time of our father Lehi left Jerusalem; and also, all that hath
      been spoken by our fathers, until now. And behold, also, they spake that which was commanded
      them of the Lord; therefore, they are just and true. And now, I say unto you, my brethren,
      that after ye have known and have been taught all these things, if ye should transgress, and
      go contrary to that which hath been spoken, that ye do withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of
      the Lord, that it may have no place in you to guide you in wisdom's paths, that ye may be
      blessed, prospered, and preserved. I say unto you, that the man that doeth this, the same
      cometh out in open rebellion against God; therefore, he listeth to obey the evil spirit, and
      becometh an enemy to all righteous; therefore, the Lord hath no place for him, for he dwelleth
      not in unholy temples. Therefore, if that man repenteth not, and remaineth and dieth an enemy
      to God, the demands of Divine Justice doth awaken his immortal soul to a lively sense of his
      own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his
      breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flames
      ascendeth up forever and ever. And now I say unto you, that mercy hath no claim on that man;
      therefore, his final doom is to endure a never ending torment. O all ye old men, and also ye
      young men, and you little children, which can understand my words,(for I have spoken plain
      unto you, that ye might understand,) I pray that ye should awake to a remembrance of the awful
      situation of those that have fallen into transgression; and moreover, I would desire that ye
      should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For
      behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out
      faithful to the end, they are received into Heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God, in a
      state of never ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord
      God hath spoken it. </text>

    <text> And again my brethren, I would call your attention, for I have somewhat more to speak
      unto you for behold, I have things to tell you, concerning that which is to come; and the
      things which I shall tell you, are made known unto me, by an Angel from God. And he said unto
      me, Awake; and I awoke, and beheld, he stood before me. And he said unto me, Awake, and hear
      the words which I shall tell thee: for behold, I am come to declare unto you the glad tidings
      of great joy. For the Lord hath heard the prayers, and hath judged of thy righteousness, and
      hath sent me to declare unto thee that thou mayest rejoice; and that thou mayest declare unto
      thy people, that they may also be filled with joy. For behold, the time cometh, and is not far
      distant, that with power, the Lord omnipotent who reigneth, which was, and is from all
      eternity to all eternity, shall come down from Heaven, among the children of men, and shall
      dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and shall go forth amongst men, working mighty miracles, such
      as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the blind to receive their
      sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all manner of diseases; and he shall cast out Devils,
      or the evil spirits which dwelleth in the hearts of the children of men. And lo, he shall
      suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can
      suffer, except it be unto death: for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be
      his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people. And he shall be called
      Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of Heaven and Earth, the creator of all things, from
      the beginning; and his mother shall be called Mary. And lo, he cometh unto his own, that
      salvation might come unto the children of men, even through faith on his name; and even after
      all this, they shall consider him a man, and say that he hath a Devil , and shall scourge him,
      and shall crucify him. And he shall rise the third day from the dead; and behold, he standeth
      to judge the world. And behold, all these things are done, that a righteous judgment might
      come upon the children of men. For behold, and also his blood atoneth for the sins of those
      who have fallen by the transgression of them, or who have ignorantly sinned. But wo, we unto
      him who knoweth that he rebelleth against God: for salvation cometh to none such, except it be
      through repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ. And the Lord God hath sent his Holy
      Prophets among all the children of men, to declare these things to every kindred, nation, and
      tongue, that thereby whosoever should believe that Christ should come, the same might receive
      remission of their sins, and rejoice with exceeding great joy, even as though he had already
      come among them. Yet the Lord saw that his people were a stiffnecked people, and he appointed
      unto them a law, even the law of Moses. And many signs, and wonders, and types, and shadows
      shewed he unto them, concerning his coming; and also Holy Prophets spake unto them concerning
      his coming; and yet they hardened their hearts, and understood not that the law of Moses
      availeth nothing, except it were through the atonement of his blood; and even if it were
      possible that little children could sin, they could not be saved; but I say unto you, they are
      blessed: for behold, as in Adam, or by nature they fall, even so the blood of Christ atoneth
      for their sins. And moreover, I say unto you, that there shall be no other names given, nor no
      other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through
      the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent. For behold, he judgeth, and his judgment is just, and
      the infant perisheth not, that dieth in his infancy; but men drinketh damnation to their own
      souls, except they humble themselves, and become as little children, and believeth that
      salvation was, and is, and is to come, in and through the atoning blood of Christ, the Lord
      Omnipotent: for the natural man is an enemy of God, and has been, from the fall of Adam, and
      will be, forever and ever; but if he yieldeth to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth
      off the natural man, and becometh a saint, through the atonement of Christ, the Lord, and
      becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love willing to submit to all
      things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his
      father. And moreover, I say unto you, that the time shall come, when the knowledge of a
      Saviour shall spread throughout every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. And behold, when
      that time cometh, none shall be found blameless before God, except it be little children, only
      through repentance and faith on the name of the Lord God Omnipotent; and even at this time,
      when thou shalt have taught thy people the things which the Lord thy God hath commanded thee,
      even then are they found no more blameless in the sight of God, only according to the words
      which I have spoken unto thee. And now, I have spoken the words which the Lord God hath
      commanded me. And thus saith the Lord: They shall stand as a bright testimony against this
      people, at the judgment day; whereof, they shall be judged, every man, according to his works,
      whether they be good, or whether they be evil; and if they be evil, they are consigned to an
      awful view of their own guilt and abominations, which doth cause them to shrink from the
      presence of the Lord, into a state of misery and endless torment, from whence they can no more
      return; therefore, they have drunk damnation to their own souls. --Therefore, they have drunk
      out of the cup of the wrath of God, which justice could no more deny unto them, than it could
      deny that Adam should fall, because of his partaking of the forbidden fruit; therefore, mercy
      could have a claim on them no more forever. And their torment is as a lake of fire and
      brimstone, whose flames are unquenchable, and whose smoke ascendeth up forever and ever. Thus
      saith the Lord commanded me. Amen, </text>

    <text> And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of speaking the words
      which had been delivered unto him by the Angel of the Lord, that he cast his eyes round about
      on the multitude, and behold, they had fell to the earth, for the fear of the Lord had come
      upon them; and they had viewed themselves in their own carnal state, even less than the dust
      of the earth. And they all cried aloud with one voice saying, O have mercy, and apply the
      atoning blood of Christ, that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be
      purified: for we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created Heaven and earth, and
      all things, who shall come down among the children of men. And it came to pass that after they
      had spoken these words, the spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy,
      having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience, because of the
      exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ which should come, according to the words which
      king Benjamin had spoken unto them. And king Benjamin again opened his mouth, and began to
      speak unto them, saying, My friends and my brethren, my kindred and my people, I would again
      call your attention, that ye may hear and understand the remainder of my words which I shall
      speak unto you: for behold, that if the knowledge of the goodness of God at this time, hath
      awakened you to a sense of your nothingness, and your worthless and fallen state; I say unto
      you, that if ye have come to a knowledge of the goodness of God, and his matchless power, and
      his wisdom, and his patience, and his long suffering towards the children of men, and also,
      the atonement which hath been prepared from the foundation of the world, that thereby
      salvation might come to him that should put his trust in the Lord, and should be diligent in
      keeping his commandments, and continue in the faith even unto the end of his life; I mean the
      life of the mortal body; I say, that this is the man that receiveth salvation, through the
      atonement which was prepared from the foundation of the world, for all mankind, which ever was
      ever since the fall of Adam, or which is or which ever shall be, even unto the end of the
      world; and this is the means whereby salvation cometh. And there is none other salvation, save
      this which hath been spoken of; neither is there any conditions whereby man can be saved,
      except the conditions which I have told you. Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he
      created all things, both in Heaven and in Earth; believe that he hath all wisdom, and all
      power, both in Heaven and in Earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which
      the Lord can comprehend. And again: Believe that ye must repent of your sins and forsake them,
      and humble yourselves before God, and ask in sincerity of the heart that he would forgive you:
      and now, if you believe all these things, see that ye do them. And again I say unto you, as I
      have said before, that as ye have come to the knowledge of the glory of God, or if ye have
      known of his goodness, and have tasted of his love, and have received a remission of your
      sins, which causeth such exceeding great joy in your souls, even so I would that ye should
      remember, and always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and your own nothingness,
      and his goodness and long suffering towards you unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even
      in the depths of humility, calling on the name of the Lord daily, and standing steadfastly in
      the faith of that which is to come, which was spoken by the mouth of the Angel; and behold, I
      say unto you that if ye do this, ye shall always rejoice, and be filled with the love of God,
      and always retain a remission of your sins; and ye shall grow in the knowledge of the glory of
      Him that created you, or in the knowledge of that which is just and true. And ye will not have
      a mind to injure one another, but to live peaceably, and to render to every man according to
      that which is his due. And ye will not suffer your children, that they go hungry, or naked;
      neither will ye suffer that they transgress the laws of God, and fight and quarrel one with
      another, and serve the Devil, which is the master of sin, or which is the evil spirit which
      hath been spoken of by our fathers; he being an enemy to all righteousness; but ye will teach
      them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one another; and
      also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your succor; ye will administer of
      your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth
      up his petition to you in vain, and turn out to perish. Perhaps thou shalt say, The man hath
      brought upon himself his misery, therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of
      my food, nor impart unto him of my substance, that he may not suffer, for his punishments are
      just. But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this, the same hath great cause to repent;
      and except he repenteth of that which he done, he perisheth forever, and hath no interest in
      the kingdom of God. For behold, are we not all beggars? Do we not all depend upon the same
      being, even God, for all substance which we have; for both food, and raiment, and for gold,
      and for silver, and for all riches which we have of every kind? And behold, even at this time,
      ye have been calling on his name, and begging for a remission of your sins. And hath he
      suffered that ye have begged in vain? Nay; he hath poured out his spirit upon, and hath caused
      that your hearts should be filled with joy, and hath caused that your mouths should be
      stopped, that ye should not find utterance, so exceeding great was your joy. And now, if God,
      who hath created you, on whom you are dependant for your lives, and for all that ye have and
      are, doth grant unto you whatsoever ye ask that is right, in faith, believing that ye shall
      receive, O then, how had ye ought to impart of the substance that ye have, one to another? And
      if ye judge the man who putteth up his petition to you for your substance, that he perish not,
      and condemn him, how much more just will be your condemnation, for withholding your substance,
      which doth not belong to you, but to God, to whom also, your life belongeth; and yet ye put up
      no petition, or repenteth not of the thing which thou hast done. --I say unto you, Wo be unto
      that man, for his substance shall perish with him, and now, I say these things unto those
      which are rich, as pertaining to the things of the world. And again, I say unto the poor, ye
      that have not and yet hath sufficient, that ye remain from day to day; I mean all you that
      deny the beggar, because ye have not; I would that ye say in your hearts, that I give not
      because I have not; but if I had, I would give. And now, if ye say this in pour hearts, ye
      remain guiltless, otherwise ye are condemned, and your condemnation is just; for ye covet that
      which ye have not received. And now, for the sake of these things which I have spoken unto
      you; that is, for the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day, that ye may
      walk guiltless before God, I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor, every
      man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting
      the sick, and administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally, according to
      their wants, and see that all these things are done in wisdom and order: for it is not
      requisite that a man should run faster than what he hath strength. And again: It is expedient
      that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be
      done in order. And I would that ye should remember, that whosoever among you that borroweth of
      his neighbor, should return the thing that he borroweth, according as he doth agree, or else
      thou shalt commit sin also. And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may
      commit sin: for there are divers ways and means, even so many, that I cannot number them. But
      this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your
      words, and your deeds, and observe to keep the commandments of God, and continue in the faith
      of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the ends of your lives, ye
      must perish. And now, O man, remember, and perish not. </text>

    <text> And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had thus spoken to his people, he sent
      among them, desiring to know of his people, if they believed the words which he had spoken
      unto them. And if they all cried with one voice, saying, Yea, we believe all the words which
      thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit
      of the Lord Omnipotent, which hath wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we
      have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually. And we, ourselves, also,
      through the infinite goodness of God, and the manifestations of his Spirit, have great views
      of that which is to come; and were it expedient, we could prophesy of all things. And it is
      the faith which we have had on the things which our king hath spoken unto us, and hath brought
      us to this great knowledge, whereby we do rejoice with such exceeding great joy; and we are
      willing to enter into a covenant with our God, to do his will, and to be obedient to his
      commandments in all things, that he shall command us, all the remainder of our days, that we
      may not bring upon ourselves a never ending torment, as has been spoken by the Angel, that we
      may not drink out of the cup of the wrath of God. And now, these are the words which king
      Benjamin desired of them; and therefore he said unto them, Ye have spoken the words that I
      desired; and the covenant which ye have made, is a righteous covenant . And now, because of
      the covenant which ye have made, ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and
      daughters: for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts
      are changed, through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him, and have become his
      sons, and daughters. And under this head, ye are made free; and there is no other head whereby
      ye can be made free. There is no other name given, whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I
      would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the
      covenant with God, that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives. And it shall come to
      pass that whosoever doeth this, shall be found at the right hand of God, for he shall know the
      name by which he is called: for he shall be called by the name of Christ. And now, it shall
      come to pass that whosoever shall not take upon them the name of Christ, must be called by
      some other name; therefore, he findeth himself on the left hand of God. And I would that ye
      should remember also, that this is the name that I said I should give you, that never should
      be blotted out, except it be through transgression; therefore, take heed that ye do not
      transgress, that the name be not blotted out of your hearts. I say unto you, I would that ye
      should remember to retain the name written always in your hearts, that ye are not found on the
      left hand of God, but that ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be called, and also,
      the name by which he shall call you: for, how knoweth a man the master which he hath not
      served, and which is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thought and intents of his
      heart? And again: Doth a man take an ass which belongeth to his neighbor, and keep him? I say
      unto you, Nay; he will not even suffer that he shall feed among his flocks, but will drive him
      away, and cast him out. I say unto you, that even so shall it be among you, if ye know not the
      name by which ye are called. Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable,
      always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal you his, that
      you may be brought to Heaven, that ye may have everlasting salvation and eternal life, through
      the wisdom, and power, and justice, and mercy of Him, who created all things, in Heaven and in
      Earth, who is God above all. Amen. </text>

    <text> And now, king Benjamin thought it was expedient, after having finished speaking to the
      people, that he should take the names of all those who had entered into a covenant with God,
      to keep his commandments. And it came to pass that there was not one soul, except it were
      little children, but what had entered into the covenant, and had taken upon them the name of
      Christ. And again: It came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of all these
      things, and had consecrated his son Mosiah, to be a ruler and a king over his people, and had
      given him all the charges concerning the kingdom, and also had appointed priests to teach the
      people, that thereby they might hear and know the commandments of God, and to stir them up in
      remembrance of the oath which they had made, he dismissed the multitude, and they returned,
      every one according to their families, to their own houses. And Mosiah began to reign in his
      father's stead. And he began to reign in the thirtieth year of his age, making in the whole,
      about four hundred and seventy-six years from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem. And king
      Benjamin lived three years, and he died. And it came to pass that king Mosiah did walk in the
      ways of the Lord, and did observe his judgments, and his statutes, and did keep his
      commandments in all things whatsoever he commanded him. And king Mosiah did cause his people
      that they should till the earth. And he also, himself did till the earth, that thereby he
      might not become burthensome to his people, that he might do according to that which his
      father had done, in all things. And there was no contention among all his people, for the
      space of three years. </text>

    <text> And now, it came to pass that after king Mosiah had had continual peace, for the space of
      three years, he was desirous to know concerning the people which went up to dwell in the land
      of Lehi-Nephi, or in the city of Lehi-Nephi: for his people had heard nothing from them, from
      the time they left the land of Zarahemla; therefore, they wearied him with their teasings. And
      it came to pass that king Mosiah granted that sixteen of their strong men might go up to the
      land of Lehi-Nephi, to inquire concerning their children. And it came to pass that on the
      morrow, they started to go up, having with them one Ammon, he being a strong and mighty man,
      and a descendant of Zarahemla; and he was also their leader. And now, they knew not the course
      they should travel in the wilderness, to go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi; therefore, they
      wandered many days in the wilderness, even forty days, did they wander. And when they had
      wandered forty days, they came to a hill, which is north of the land of Shilom, and there they
      pitched their tents. And Ammon took three of his brethren, and their names were Amaleki,
      Helem, and Hem, and they `went down into the land of Nephi; and behold, they met the king of
      the people, which was in the land of Nephi, and in the land of Shilom; and they were
      surrounded by the king's guard, and was taken, and was bound, and was committed to prison. And
      it came to pass hem they had been in prison two days, they were again brought before the king,
      and their bands were loosed; and they stood before the king, and was permitted or rather
      commanded that they should answer the questions which he should ask them. And he saith unto
      them, Behold, I am Limhi, the son of Noah, which was the son of Zeniff, which came up out of
      the land of Zarahemla to inherit this land, which was the land of their fathers, which was
      made a king by the voice of the people. And now, I desire to know the cause whereby ye were so
      bold as to come near the walls of the city, when I, myself, was with my guards, without the
      gate? And now, for this cause have I suffered that ye should be preserved, that I might
      inquire of you, or else I should have caused that my guards should have put you to death. --Ye
      are permitted to speak. And now, when Ammon saw that he was permitted to speak, he went forth
      and bowed himself before the king; and rising again, he said, O king, I am very thankful
      before God this day, that I am yet alive, and am permitted to speak; and I will endeavor to
      speak with boldness: for I am assured that if ye had known me, ye would not have suffered that
      I should have wore these bands. For I am Ammon, and am a descendant of Zarahemla, and have
      come up out of the land of Zarahemla, to inquire concerning our brethren, which Zeniff brought
      up out of that land. And now, it came to pass that after Limhi had heard the words of Ammon,
      he was exceeding glad, and said, Now, I know of a surety that my brethren which was in the
      land of Zarahemla, are yet alive. And now, I will rejoice; and on the morrow, I will cause
      that my people shall rejoice also. For behold, we are in bondage to the Lamanites, and are
      taxed with a tax which is grievous to be borne. And now, behold, our brethren will deliver us
      out of our bondage, or out of the hands of the Lamanites, and we will be their slaves: for it
      is better that we be slaves to the Nephites, than to pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites.
      And now, king Limhi commanded his guards that they should no more bind Ammon, nor his
      brethren, but caused that they should go to the hill which was north of Shilom, and bring
      their brethren into the city, that thereby they might eat, and drink, and rest, themselves
      from the labors of their journey; for they had suffered many things: they had suffered hunger,
      thirst, and fatigue. And now, it came to pass on the morrow, that king Limhi sent a
      proclamation among all his people, that thereby they might gather themselves together to the
      temple, to hear that the words which he should speak unto them. And it came to pass that when
      they had gathered themselves together, that he spake unto them in this wise, saying, O ye, my
      people, lift up your heads and be comforted: for behold, the time is at hand, or is not far
      distant, when we shall no longer be in subjection to our enemies, notwithstanding our many
      strugglings, which have been in vain; yet I trust there remaineth an effectual struggle to be
      made. Therefore, lift up your heads, and rejoice, and put your trust in God, in that God who
      was the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; and also, that God who brought the Children of
      Israel out of the land of Egypt, and caused that they should walk through the Red Sea on dry
      ground, and fed them with manna, that they might not perish in the wilderness; and many more
      things did he do for them. And again: That same God hath brought our fathers out of the land
      of Jerusalem, and hath kept and preserved his people, even until now. And behold, it is
      because of our iniquities and abominations, that has brought us into bondage. --And ye all are
      witnesses this day, that Zeniff, who was made king over this people, he being over zealous to
      inherit the land of his fathers, therefore being deceived by the cunning and craftiness of
      king Laman, who having entered into a treaty with king Zeniff, and having yielded up into his
      hands the possessions of a part of the land, or even the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of
      Shilom, and the land round about; and all this he done, for the sole purpose of bringing this
      people into subjection, or is bondage. And behold, we at this time do pay tribute to the king
      of the Lamanites, to the amount of one half of our corn, and our barley, and even all our
      grain of every kind, and one half of the increase of our flocks, and our herds; and even one
      half of all we have or possess. the king of the Lamanites doth exact of us, or our lives. And
      now, is not this grievous to be borne? And is not this, our afflictions great? Now behold, how
      great reason have we to mourn. Yea, I say unto you, great are the reasons which we have to
      mourn: for behold, how many of our brethren have been slain, and their blood hath been spilt
      in vain, and all because of iniquity. For if this people had not fallen into transgression,
      the Lord would not have suffered that this great evil should come upon them. But behold, they
      would not hearken unto his words; but there arose contentions among them, even so much that
      they did shed blood among themselves. And a Prophet of the Lord have they slain; yea, a chose
      man of God, who told them of their wickedness and abominations, and prophesied of many things
      which is to come, yea, even the coming of Christ. And because he saith unto them, That Christ
      was the God, the Father of all things, and saith that he should take upon him the image of
      man, and it should be the image after which man was created after the image of God, and that
      God should come down among the children of men, and take upon him flesh and blood, and go
      forth upon the face of the earth; and now, because he said this, they put him to death; and
      many more things did they do, which brought down the wrath of God upon them. Therefore, who
      wondereth that they are in bondage, and that they are smitten with sore afflictions? For
      behold, the Lord hath said, I will not succor my people in the day of their transgression; but
      I will hedge up their ways, that they prosper not, and their doing shall be as a stumbling
      block before them. And again, He saith, If my people shall sow filthiness, they shall reap the
      chaff thereof, in the whirlwind; and the effects thereof is poison, And again: He saith, If my
      people shall sow filthiness, they shall reap the east wind, which bringeth immediate
      destruction. And now, behold, the promise of the Lord is fulfilled; and ye are smitten, and
      afflicted. But if ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and put your trust in
      him, and serve him will all diligence of mind; and if ye do this, he will, according to his
      own will and pleasure, deliver you out of bondage. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that after king Limhi had made an end of speaking to his people, for
      he spake many things unto them, and only a few of them have I written in this book, he told
      his people all the things concerning their brethren which were in the land of Zarahemla; and
      he caused that Ammon should stand up before the multitude, and rehearse unto them all that had
      happened unto their brethren, from the time that Zeniff went up out of the land, even until
      the time that he, himself came out of the land. And he also rehearsed unto them the last words
      which king Benjamin had taught them, and explained them to the people of king Limhi, so that
      they might understand all the words he spake. And it came to pass that after he had done all
      this, that the king Limhi dismissed the multitude, and caused that they should return, every
      one unto his own house. And it came to pass that he caused that the plates which contained the
      record of his people, from the time before Ammon, that he might read them. Now, as soon as
      Ammon had read the record, the king inquired of him to know if he could interpret languages.
      And Ammon told him that he could not. And the king saith unto him, I being grieved for the
      afflictions of my people, I caused that forty and three of my people should take a journey
      into the wilderness, that thereby they might find the land of Zarahemla; that we might appeal
      unto our brethren to deliver us out of bondage; and they were lost in the wilderness, for the
      space of many days, yet they were diligent, and found not the land of Zarahemla, but returned
      to this land, having travelled in a land among many waters; having discovered a land which was
      covered with ruins of buildings of every kind; having discovered a land which had been peopled
      with a people, which were as numerous as the hosts of Israel. And for a testimony that the
      things that they have said is true, they have brought twenty-four plates, which are filled
      with engravings; and they are of pure gold. And behold, also, they have brought breast-
      plates, which are large; and they are of brass, and of copper, and are perfectly sound. And
      again: They have brought swords, the hilts thereof hath perished, and the blades thereof were
      cankered with rust; and there is no one in the land that is able to interpret the language of
      the engravings that are on the plates. Therefore, I said unto thee, Canst thou translate? And
      I say unto you again, Knowest thou of any one that can translate? for I am desirous that these
      records should be translated into our language. For, perhaps they will give us a knowledge of
      a remnant of the people which have been destroyed, from whence these records came; or, perhaps
      they will give us a knowledge of this very people which hath been destroyed; and I am desirous
      to know the cause of their destruction. Now, Ammon saith unto him, I can assuredly tell thee,
      O king, of a man that can translate the records: for he hath wherewith that he can look, and
      translate all records that are of ancient date; and it is a gift from God. And the things are
      called interpreters; and no man can look in them, except he be commanded, lest he should look
      for that he had not ought, and he should perish. And whosoever is commanded to look in them,
      the same is called seer. And behold, the king of the people which is in the land of Zarahemla,
      is the man that is commanded to do these things, and which hath this high gift from God. And
      the king saith, That a seer is greater than a prophet. And Ammon saith, That a seer is a
      revelator, and a prophet also; and a gift which is greater, can no man have, except he should
      possess the power of God, which no man can; yet a man may have great power given him from God.
      But a seer can know of things which has past, and also of things which is to come; and by them
      shall all things be revealed, or rather, shall secret things be made manifest, and hidden
      things shall come to light, and things which is not known, shall be made known by them; and
      also, things shall be made known by them, which otherwise could not be known. Thus God hath
      provided a means that man, through faith, might work mighty miracles; therefore, he becometh a
      great benefit to his fellow beings. And now, when Ammon had made an end of speaking these
      words, the king rejoiced exceedingly, and gave thanks to God, saying, Doubtless, a great
      mystery is contained within these plates; and these interpreters was doubtless prepared for
      the purpose of unfolding all such mysteries to the children of men. O how marvellous are the
      works of the Lord, and how long doth he suffer with his people; yea, and how blind and
      impenetrable are the understandings of the children of men: for they shall not seek wisdom,
      neither do they desire that she should rule over them. Yea, they are as a wild flock, which
      fleeth from the shepherd, and scattereth, and are driven, and are devoured by the beasts of
      the forest. </text>

    <text> I, Zeniff, having been taught in all the language of the Nephites, and having had a
      knowledge of the land of Nephi, or the land of our father's first inheritance, and I having
      been sent as a spy among the Lamanites, that I might spy out their forces, that our army might
      come upon them and destroy them; but when I saw that which was good among them, I was desirous
      that they should not be destroyed; therefore, I contended with my brethren in the wilderness:
      for I would that our ruler should make a treaty with them. But he being an austere and a
      blood-thirsty man, commanded that I should be slain; but I was rescued, by the shedding of
      much blood: for father fought against father, and brother against brother, until the greatest
      number of our army was destroyed in the wilderness; and we returned, those of us that were
      spared, to the land of Zarahemla, to relate that tale to their wives, and their children. And
      yet, I being over zealous to inherit the land of our fathers, collected as many as were
      desirous to go up to possess the land, and started again on our journey into the wilderness,
      to go up to the land; but we were smitten with famine and sore afflictions: for we were slow
      to remember the Lord our God. Nevertheless, after many days wandering in the wilderness, we
      pitched our tents in the place where our brethren were slain, which was near the land of our
      fathers. And it came to pass that I went again with four of my men, into the city, in unto the
      king, that I might know of the disposition of the king, and that I might know if I might go in
      with my people, and possess the land in peace. And I went in unto the king, and he covenanted
      me, that I might possess the land of Lehi-Nephi, and the land of Shilom. And he also commanded
      that his people should depart out of the land, and I and my people went into the land, that we
      might possess it. And we began to build buildings, and to repair the walls of the city of
      Shilom. And we began to till the ground, yea, even with all manner of seeds, with seeds of
      corn, and of wheat, and of barley, and with peas, and with sheum, and with seeds of all manner
      of fruits: and we did begin to multiply and prosper in the land. Now, it was the cunning and
      the craftiness of king Laman, to bring my people into bondage, that he yielded up the land,
      that we might possess it. Therefore, it came to pass that after we had dwelt in the land for
      the space of twelve years, that king Laman began to grow uneasy, lest by any means my people
      should wax strong in the land, and that they could not overpower them and bring them into
      bondage. Now, they were a lazy, and an idolatrous people; therefore, they were desirous to
      bring us into bondage, that they might glut themselves with the labors of our hands; yea, that
      they might feast themselves upon the flocks of our fields. Therefore, it came to pass that
      king Laman began to stir up his people, that they should contend with my people; therefore,
      there began to be wars and contentions in the land. For, in the thirteeneth year of my reign
      in the land of Nephi, away on the south of the land of Shilom, when my people were watering
      and feeding their flocks, and tilling their lands, a numerous host of Lamanites came upon
      them, and began to slay them, and to take of their flocks, and the corn of their fields. Yea,
      and it came to pass that they fled, all that were not overtaken, even into the city of Nephi,
      and did call upon me for protection. And it came to pass that I did arm them with bows, and
      with arrows, with swords, and with cimeters, and with clubs, and with slings, and with all
      manner of weapons which we could invent, and I and my people did go forth against the
      Lamanites, to battle; yea, in the strength of the Lord did we go forth to battle against the
      Lamanites: for I and my people did cry mightily to the Lord, that he would deliver us out of
      the hands of our enemies, for we were awakened to a remembrance of the deliverance of our
      fathers. And God did hear our cries, and did answer our prayers; and we did go forth in his
      might. Yea, we did go forth against the Lamanites; and in one day and a night, we did slay
      three thousand and forty-three; we did slay them, even until we had driven them out of our
      land. And I, myself, with mine own hands, did help to bury their dead. And behold, to our
      great sorrow and lamentation, two hundred and seventy-nine of our brethren were slain. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that we again began to establish the kingdom; and we again began to
      possess the land in peace. And I caused that there should be weapons of war made, of every
      kind, that thereby I might have weapons for my people, against the time the Lamanites should
      come up again to war against my people. And I set guards round about the land, that the
      Lamanites might not come upon us again unawares, and destroy us; and thus I did guard my
      people, and my flocks, and keep them from falling into the hands of our enemies. And it came
      to pass that we did inherit the land of our fathers, for many years; yea, for the space of
      twenty and two years. And I did cause that the men should till the ground, and raise all
      manner of grain, and all manner of fruit, of every kind. And I did cause that the women should
      spin, and toil, and work, and work all manner of fine linen; yea, and cloth of every kind,
      that we might clothe our nakedness; and thus we did prosper in the land; thus we did have
      continual peace in the land, for the space of twenty and two years. And it came to pass king
      Laman died, and his son began to reign in his stead. And he began to stir his people up in
      rebellion against my people; therefore, they began to prepare for war, and to come up to
      battle against my people. --But I having sent my spies out round about the land of Shemlon,
      that I might discover their preparations, that I might guard against them, that they might not
      come upon my people and destroy them. And it came to pass that they came up upon the north of
      the land of Shilom, with their numerous hosts, men armed with bows, and with arrows, and with
      swords, and with cimeters, and with stones, and with slings; and they had their heads shaved,
      that they were naked; and they were girded about with a leathern girdle about their loins. And
      it came to pass that I caused that the women and children of my people should be hid in the
      wilderness; and I also caused that all my old men that could bear arms, and also all my young
      men that were able to bear arms, should gather themselves together, to go to battle against
      the Lamanites; and I did place them in their ranks, every man according to his age. And it
      came to pass that we did go up to battle against the Lamanites. And I, even I, in my old age,
      did go up to battle against the Lamanites. And it came to pass that we did go up in the
      strength of the Lord, to battle. Now, the Lamanites knew nothing concerning the Lord, nor the
      strength of the Lord; therefore, they depended upon their own strength. Yet they were a strong
      people, as to the strength of men: they were a wild and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people,
      believing in the tradition of their fathers, which is this: Believing that they were driven
      out of the land of Jerusalem. because of the iniquities of their fathers, and that they were
      wronged in the wilderness by their brethren; and they were also wronged, while crossing the
      sea. And again: That they were wronged while in the land of their first inheritance, after
      they had crossed the sea; and all this, because that Nephi was more faithful in keeping the
      commandments of the Lord; therefore he was favored of the Lord, for the Lord heard his prayers
      and answered them, and he took the lead of their journey in the wilderness. And his brethren
      were wroth with him, because they understood not the dealings of the Lord; they were also
      wroth with him upon the waters, because they hardened their hearts against the Lord. And
      again: They were wroth with him, when they had arriven to the promised land, because they said
      that he had taken the ruling of the people out of their hands; and they sought to kill him.
      And again: They were wroth with him, because he departed into the wilderness as the Lord
      commanded him, and took the records which were engraven on the plates of brass; for they said
      he robbed them. And thus they have taught their children, that they should hate them, and that
      they should murder them, and that they should rob and plunder them, and do all they could to
      destroy them; therefore, they have an eternal hatred towards the children of Nephi. For this
      very cause hath king Laman, by his cunning and lying craftiness, and his far promises, hath
      deceived me, that I have brought this, my people, up into this land, that they may destroy
      them; yea, and we have suffered this many years in the land. And now, I, Zeniff, after having
      told all these things unto my people concerning the Lamanites, I did stimulate them to go to
      battle with their might, putting their trust in the Lord; therefore, we did contend with them,
      face to face. And it came to pass that we did drive them again out of our land; and we slew
      them with a great slaughter, even so many that we did not number them. And it came to pass
      that we returned again to our own land, and my people again began to tend their flocks, and to
      till their ground. And now, I being old, did confer the kingdom upon one of my sons;
      therefore, I say no more. And may the Lord bless my people. Amen. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that Zeniff conferred the kingdom upon Noah, one of his sons;
      therefore Noah began to reign in his stead; and he did not walk in the ways of his father. For
      behold, he did not keep the commandments of God, but he did walk after the desires of his own
      heart. And he had many wives and concubines. And he did cause his people to commit sin, and do
      that which was abominable in the sight of the Lord. Yea, and they did commit whoredoms, and
      all manner of wickedness. And he laid a tax of one fifth part of all they possessed; and a
      fifth part of their gold and of their silver, and a fifth part of their ziff, and of their
      copper, and of their brass and their iron; and a fifth part of their fatlings; and also, a
      fifth part of all their grain. And all this did he take, to support himself, and his wives,
      and his concubines, and also, his priests, and their wives, and their concubines; thus he had
      changed the affairs of the kingdom. For he put down all the priests that had been consecrated
      by his father, and consecrated new ones in their stead, such as were lifted up in pride of
      their hearts. Yea, and thus were they supported in their laziness, and in their idolatry, and
      in their whoredoms, by the taxes which king Noah had put upon his people; thus did the people
      labor exceedingly, to support iniquity. Yea, and they also became idolatrous, because they
      were deceived by the vain and flattering words of the king and priests; for they did speak
      flattering things unto them. And it came to pass that king Noah built many elegant and
      spacious buildings; and he ornamented them with fine work of wood, and of all manner of
      precious things, of gold, and of silver, and of iron, and of brass, and of ziff, and of
      copper; and he also built him a spacious palace, and a throne in the midst thereof, all of
      which was of fine wood, and was ornamented with gold and silver, and with precious things. And
      he also caused that his workmen should work all manner of fine work within the walls of the
      temple, of fine wood, and of copper, and of brass; and the seats which was set apart for the
      high priests, which was above all the other seats, he did ornament with pure gold; and he
      caused a breastwork to be built before them, that they might rest their bodies and their arms
      upon, while they should speak lying and vain words to his people. And it came to pass that he
      built a tower near the temple; yea, a very high tower, even so high that he could stand upon
      the top thereof and overlook the land of Shilom, and also the land of Shemlon, which was
      possessed by the Lamanites; and he could even look over all the land round about. And it came
      to pass that he caused many buildings to be built in the land of Shilom; and he caused a great
      tower to be built on the hill north of the land of Shilom, which had been a resort for the
      children of Nephi, at the time they fled out of the land; and thus he did do with the riches
      which he obtained by the taxation of his people. And it came to pass that he placed his heart
      upon his riches, and he spent his time in riotous living with his wives and his concubines;
      and so did also his priests spend their time with harlots. And it came to pass that he planted
      vineyards round about in the land; and he built wine presses, and made wine in abundance; and
      therefore he became a wine bidder, and also his people. And it came to pass that the Lamanites
      began to come in upon his people, upon small numbers, and to slay them in their fields, and
      while they were tending their flocks. And king Noah sent guards round about the land to keep
      them off; but he did not send a sufficient number, and the Lamanites came upon them and killed
      them, and drove many of their flocks out of the land: thus the Lamanites began to destroy them
      and to exercise their hatred upon them. And it came to pass that king Noah sent his armies
      against them, and they were driven back, or they drove them back for a time; therefore, they
      returned rejoicing in their spoil. And now, because of this great victory, they were lifted up
      in the pride of their hearts; they did boast in their own strength, saying, That their fifty
      could stand against thousands of the Lamanites; and thus they did boast, and did delight in
      blood, and the shedding of the blood. of their brethren, and this because of the wickedness of
      their king and priests. And it came to pass that there was a man among them, whose name was
      Abinadi; and he went forth among them, and began to prophesy, saying, Behold, thus saith the
      Lord, and thus hath he commanded me, saying, Go forth and say unto this people, thus saith the
      Lord: Wo be unto this people, for I have seen their abominations, and their wickedness, and
      their whoredoms; and except they repent, I will visit them in mine anger. And except they
      repent, and turn to the Lord their God, behold, I will deliver them into the hands of their
      enemies; yea, and they shall be brought into bondage; and they shall be afflicted by the hand
      of their enemies. And it shall come to pass that they shall know that I am the Lord their God,
      and am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of my people. And it shall come to pass that
      except this people repent, and turn unto the Lord their God, they shall be brought into
      bondage; and none shall deliver them, except it be the Lord the Almighty God. Yea, and it
      shall come to pass that when they shall cry unto me, I will be slow to hear their cries; yea,
      and I will suffer them that they be smitten by their enemies. And except they repent in
      sackcloth and ashes, and cry mightily to the Lord their God, I will not hear their prayers,
      neither will I deliver them out of their afflictions; and thus saith the Lord, and thus hath
      he commanded me. Now it came to pass that when Abinadi had spoken these words unto them, they
      were wroth with him, and sought to take away his life; but the Lord delivered him out of their
      hands. Now when king Noah had heard of the words which Abinadi had spake unto the people, he
      was also wroth; and he saith, Who is Abinadi, that I and my people should be judged of him? or
      who is the Lord, that shall bring upon my people such great affliction? I command you to bring
      Abinadi hither, that I may slay him: for he hath said these things, that he might stir up my
      people to anger, one with another, and to raise contentions among my people; therefore, I will
      slay him. Now the eyes of the people were blinded; therefore, they hardened their hearts
      against the words of Abinadi, and they sought from that time forward to take him. And king
      Noah hardened his heart against the word of the Lord; and he did not repent his evil doings.

    <text> And it came to pass that after the space of two years, that Abinadi came among them in
      disguise, that they knew him not, and began again to prophesy among them, saying, Thus hath
      the Lord commanded me saying: Abinadi, go and prophesy unto this my people, for they have
      hardened their hearts against my words; they have repented not of their evil doings;
      therefore, I will visit them in my anger, yea, in my fierce anger will I visit them in their
      iniquities and abominations; yea, wo be unto this generation. And the Lord said unto me,
      Stretch forth thy hand, and prophesying, saying, Thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass
      that this generation, because of their iniquities, shall be brought into bondage, and shall be
      smitten on the cheek; yea, and shall be driven by men, and shall be slain; and the vultures of
      the air, and the dogs, yea, and the wild beasts, shall devour their flesh. And it shall come
      to pass that the life of king Noah shall be valued even as a garment in a hot furnace; for he
      shall know that I am the Lord. And it shall come to pass that I will smite this my people,
      with sore afflictions; yea, with famine and with pestilence; and I will cause that ye shall
      howl all the day long. Yea, and I will cause that they shall have burdens lashed upon their
      backs; and they shall be driven before, like a dumb ass. And it shall come to pass that I will
      send forth hail among them, and it shall smite them; and they shall also be smitten with the
      east wind; and insects shall pester their land also, and devour their grain. And they shall be
      smitten with a great pestilence; and all this will I do, because of their iniquities and
      abominations. And it shall come to pass that except they repent, I will utterly destroy them
      from off the face of the earth; yet they shall leave a record behind them, and I will preserve
      them for other nations which shall possess the land; yea, even this will I do, that I may
      discover the abominations, of this people to other nations. And many things did Abinadi
      prophesy against this people. And it came to pass that they were angry with him; and they took
      him and carried him bound before the king, and saith unto the king, Behold, we have brought a
      man before thee which has prophesied evil concerning thy people, and saith that God will
      destroy them; and he also prophesieth evil concerning thy life, and saith that thy life shall
      be as a garment in a furnace of fire. And again: He saith that thou shalt be as a stalk, even
      as a dry stalk of the field, which is ran over by the beasts and trodden under foot. And
      again; He saith thou shalt be as the blossoms of a thistle, which when it is fully ripe, if
      the wind bloweth, it is driven forth upon the face of the land; and he pretendeth the Lord
      hath spoken it. And he saith all this shall come upon thee, except thou repent; and this
      because of thine iniquities. And now, O king, what great evil hast thou done, or what great
      sins has thy people committed, that we should be condemned of God, or judged of this man? And
      now, O king, behold, we are guiltless, and thou, O king hast not sinned; therefore, this man
      hast lied concerning you, and he hath prophesied in vain. And behold, we are strong, we shall
      not come into bondage, or be taken captive by our enemies; yea, and thou hast prospered in the
      land, and thou shalt also prosper. Behold, here is the man, we deliver him into thy hands;
      thou mayest do with him as seemeth thee good. And it came to pass that king Noah caused that
      Abinadi should be cast into prison; and he commanded that the priests should gather themselves
      together, that he might hold a council with them what he should do with him. And it came to
      pass that they saith unto the king, Bring him hither, that we may question him. And the king
      commanded that he should be brought before them. And they began to question him, that they
      might cross him, that thereby they might have wherewith to accuse him; but he answered them
      boldly, and withstood all their questions, yea, to their astonishment: for he did withstand
      them in all their questions, and did confound them in all their words. And it came to pass
      that one of them saith unto him, What meaneth the words which are written, and which have been
      taught by our fathers, saying: How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of Him that
      bringeth good tidings; that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good; that
      publisheth salvation; that sayeth unto Zion, Thy God reigneth; thy watchmen shall lift up the
      voice with the voice; together shall they sing, for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord
      shall bring again Zion. Break forth into joy; sing together ye waste places of Jerusalem: for
      the Lord hath comforted his people; he hath redeemed Jerusalem. The Lord hath made bare his
      holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation
      of our God. And now Abinadi saith unto them, Are you priests? and pretend to teach this
      people, and to understand the spirit of prophesying, and yet desireth to know of me what these
      things mean? I say unto you, Wo be unto you for perverting the ways of the Lord. For if ye
      understand these things, ye have not taught them; therefore, ye have perverted the ways of the
      Lord. --Ye have not applied your hearts to understanding; therefore, ye have not been wise.
      Therefore, what teacheth thou this people? And they said, We teach the law of Moses. And
      again, He saith unto them, if ye teach the law of Moses, why do ye not keep it? Why do ye set
      your hearts upon riches? Why do ye commit whoredoms, and spend your strength with harlots,
      yea, and cause this people to commit sin, that the Lord hath caused to send me to prophesy
      against this people, yea, even a great evil against this people? Knowest thou not that I speak
      the truth? Yea, thou knowest that I speak the truth; and you had ought to tremble before God.
      And it shall come to pass, that ye shall be smitten for thine iniquities: for ye had said that
      ye teach the law of Moses. And what knowest thou concerning the law of Moses? Doth salvation
      come by the law of Moses? What sayest thou? And they answered and said, that salvation did
      come by the law of Moses. But now Abinadi saith unto them, I know if ye keep the commandments
      of God, ye shall be saved; yea, if ye keep the commandments which the Lord delivered unto
      Moses in the mount of Sinai, saying: I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the
      land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other God before me. Thou shalt
      not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing in the heaven above, or the
      things which is in the earth beneath. Now Abinadi saith unto them, Have ye done all this? I
      say unto you, Nay, ye have not. And have ye taught this people that they should do all these
      things? I say unto you, Nay, ye have not. </text>

    <text> And now that when the king had heard these words, he said unto his priests, Away with
      this fellow, and slay him: for what have we to do with him, for he is mad. And they stood
      forth and attempted to lay hands on him; but he withstood them, and said unto them, Touch me
      not, for God shall smite you if ye lay your hands upon me, for I have not delivered the
      message which the Lord sent me to deliver; neither have I told you that which ye requested
      that I should tell; therefore, God will not suffer that I shall be destroyed at this time. For
      I must fulfil the commandments wherewith God hath commanded me; and because I have told you
      the truth, ye are angry with me. And again: Because I have spoken the word of God, you have
      judged me that I am mad. Now it came to pass after Abinadi had spoken these words, that the
      people of king Noah durst not lay their hands on him; for the Spirit of the Lord was upon him;
      and his face shone with exceeding lustre, even as Moses did while in the mount of Sinai, while
      speaking with the Lord. And he spake with power and authority from God; and he continued his
      words, saying, Ye see that ye have not power to slay me, therefore, I finish my message. Yea,
      and I perceive that it cuts you to your hearts, because I tell you the truth concerning your
      iniquities; yea, and my words fill you with wonder and amazement, and with anger. But I finish
      my message; and then it matters not whither I go, if it so be that I am saved. But this much I
      tell you: What you do with me after this, shall be as a type and a shadow of things which is
      to come. And now I read unto you the remainder of the commandments of God, for I perceive that
      they are not written in your hearts; I perceive that ye have studied and taught iniquity the
      most part of your lives. And now, ye remember that I said unto you, Thou shalt not make unto
      thee any graven images, or any likeness of things which is in heaven above, or which is in the
      earth beneath, or which is in the water under the earth. And again: Thou shalt not bow down
      thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the
      iniquities of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generations of them
      that hate me; and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
      --Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the Lord will not hold him
      guiltless that taketh his name in vain. Remember the sabbath-day, to keep it holy. Six days
      shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day, the sabbath of the Lord thy God,
      thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy
      maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the
      Lord mad heaven and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is; wherefore the Lord blessed
      the sabbath-day, and hallowed it. Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long
      upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not commit
      adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor. Thou
      shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his
      man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is they
      neighbor's. And it came to pass that after Abinadi had made an end of these sayings, that he
      said unto them, Have ye taught this people that they should observe to do all these things?
      For to keep these commandments? I say unto you, Nay; for if ye had, the Lord would not have
      caused me to come forth and to prophesy evil concerning this people. And now ye have said the
      salvation cometh by the law of Moses. I say unto you that it is expedient that ye should keep
      the law of Moses as yet; but I say unto you, that the time shall come when it shall no more be
      expedient to keep the law of Moses. And moreover, I say unto you, that salvation doth not come
      by the law alone; and were it not for the atonement which God himself shall make for the sins
      and iniquities of his people, that they must unavoidably perish, notwithstanding the law of
      Moses. And now I say unto you, that it was expedient that there should be a law given to the
      children of Israel, yea, even a very strict law: for they were a stiffnecked people, quick to
      do iniquity, and slow to remember the Lord their God; therefore there was a law given them,
      yea, a law of performances and of ordinances, a law which they were to observe strictly, from
      day to day, to keep them in remembrance of God, and their duty towards him. But behold, I say
      unto you, that all these things were types of things to come. And now, did they understand the
      law? I say unto you, Nay, they did not all understand the law; and this because of the
      hardness of their hearts: for they understood not that there could not any man be saved,
      except it were through the redemption of God. For behold, did not Moses prophesy unto them
      concerning the coming of the Messiah, and that God should redeem his people, yea, and even all
      the prophets which have prophesied ever since the world began? Have they not spoken more or
      less concerning these things? Have they not said that God himself should come down among the
      children of men, and take upon him the form of man, and go forth in mighty power upon the face
      of the earth? Yea, and have they not said also, that he should bring to pass the resurrection
      of the dead, and that he himself should be oppressed and afflicted? </text>

    <text> Yes, even doth not Isaiah say, Who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of
      the Lord revealed? for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of dry
      ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we
      should desire him. He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with
      grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
      Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken,
      smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for
      our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are
      healed. All we, like sheep, have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the
      lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he
      opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her
      shearers is dumb, so he opened not his mouth. He was taken from prison and from judgment: and
      who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the
      transgressions of my people was he stricken. And he made his grave with the wicked, and with
      the rich in his death; because he had done no evil, neither was any deceit in his mouth. Yet
      it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an
      offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the
      lord shall prosper in his hand. He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be
      satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their
      iniquities. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the
      spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered
      with the transgressors; and he bare the sins of many, and made intercession for the
      transgressors. </text>

    <text> And now Abinadi saith unto them, I would that ye should understand that God himself shall
      come down among the children of men, and shall redeem his people; and because he dwelleth in
      flesh, he shall be called the Son of God: and having subjected the flesh to the will of the
      Father, being the Father and the Son; the Father because he was conceived by the power of God;
      and the Son, because of the flesh; thus becoming the Father and Son: and they are one God,
      yea, the very Eternal Father of Heaven and of Earth; and thus the flesh becoming subject to
      the Spirit, or the Son to the Father, being one God, suffereth temptation, and yieldeth not to
      the temptation, but suffereth himself to be mocked, and scourged, and cast out, and disowned
      by his people. And after all this, and after working many mighty miracles among the children
      of men, he shall be led, yea, even as Isaiah said; As a sheep before the shearer is dumb, so
      he opened not his mouth; yea, even so he shall be led, crucified, and slain, the flesh
      becoming subject even unto death, the will of the Son being swallowed up in the will of the
      Father; and thus God breaketh the bands of death; having gained the victory over death; giving
      the Son power to make intercession for the children of men; having ascended into heaven;
      having the bowels of mercy; being filled with compassion toward the children of men; standing
      betwixt them and justice; having broken the bands of death, taken upon himself their iniquity
      and their transgressions; having redeemed them, and satisfied the demands of justice. And now
      I say unto you, Who shall declare his generation? Behold, I say unto you, that when his soul
      has been made an offering for sin, he shall see his seed. And now what say ye? And who shall
      be his seed? Behold I say unto you, that whosoever hath heard the words of the prophets, yea,
      all the Holy Prophets which have prophesied concerning the coming of the Lord; I say unto,
      that all those who hath hearkened unto their words, and believed that the Lord would redeem
      his people, and have looked forward to that day for a remission of their sins; I say unto you,
      that these are his seed, or they are heirs of the Kingdom of God: for these are they whose
      sins he hath borne; these are they for whom he hath died, to redeem them from their
      transgressions. And now, are they not his seed? Yea, and are not the prophets, every one that
      has opened his mouth to prophesy, that has not fallen into transgression; I mean all the Holy
      Prophets ever since the world began; I say unto you that they are his seed; and these are they
      which hath published peace, that hath brought good tidings of good, that hath published
      salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth! And O how beautiful upon the mountains were
      their feet! And again: How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that are still
      publishing peace! And again: How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those who shall
      hereafter publish peace, yea, from this time henceforth and forever! And behold, I say unto
      you, this is not all: For O how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth
      good tidings, that is the founder of peace; yea, even the Lord, who hath redeemed his people;
      yea, him who hath granted salvation unto his people: for were it not for the redemption which
      he hath made for his people, which was prepared from the foundation of the world; I say unto
      you, were it not for this, that all mankind must have perished. But behold, the bands of death
      shall be broken, and the Son reigneth, and hath power over the dead; therefore, he bringeth to
      pass the resurrection of the dead. And there cometh a resurrection, even a first resurrection;
      yea, even a resurrection of those that have been and which are, and which shall be, even until
      the resurrection of Christ: for so shall he be called. And now, the resurrection of all the
      prophets, and all those that have believed in their words, or all those that have kept the
      commandments of God, these shall come forth in the first resurrection; therefore, they are the
      first resurrection. They are raised to dwell with God, who hath redeemed them: thus they have
      eternal life through Christ, who hath broken the bands of death. And there are those who have
      a part in the first resurrection; and these are they that have died before Christ came, in
      their ignorance, not having salvation declared unto them. And thus the Lord bringeth about the
      restoration of these, and they have a part in the first resurrection, or hath eternal life,
      being redeemed by the Lord. And little children also, hath eternal life. But behold, and fear,
      and tremble before God; for ye had ought to tremble: for the Lord redeemeth none such that
      rebelleth against him, and dieth in their sins; yea, even all those that have perished in
      their sins ever since the world began, that have wilfully rebelled against God, that have
      known the commandments of God, and would not keep them; these are they that have no part in
      the first resurrection. Therefore, had ye not ought to tremble? For salvation cometh to none
      such; for the Lord hath redeemed none such; yea, neither can the Lord redeem such: for he
      cannot deny himself; for he cannot deny justice when it hath its claim. And now I say unto
      you, that the time shall come that the salvation of the Lord shall be declared to every
      nation, kindred, tongue, and people. Yea, Lord, the watchmen shall lift up their voice; with
      the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring
      again Zion. Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the Lord
      hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem. The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in
      the eyes of all the nations: and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.

    <text> And now it came to pass that after Abinadi had spoken these words, he stretched forth his
      hand and said, The time shall come when all shall see the salvation of the Lord; when every
      nation, kindred, tongue and people, shall see eye to eye, and shall confess before God that
      his judgments are just; and then shall the wicked be cast out, and they shall have cause to
      howl, and weep, and wail, and gnash their teeth; and this because they would not hearken unto
      the voice of the Lord; therefore the Lord redeemeth them not, for they are carnal and devlish,
      and the devil hath power over them; yea, even that old serpent that did beguile our first
      parents, which was the cause of their fall; which was the cause of all mankind becoming
      carnal, sensual, devlish, knowing evil from good, subjecting themselves to the devil. Thus all
      mankind were lost; and behold, they would have been endlessly lost, were it not that God
      redeemed his people from their lost and fallen state. But remember, that he that persists in
      his own carnal nature, and goes on in the ways of sin and rebellion against God, he remaineth
      in his fallen state, and the devil hath power over him. Therefore he is as though there was no
      redemption made; being an enemy to God; and also is the devil an enemy to God. And now if
      Christ had not come into the world, speaking of things to come, as though they had already
      come, there could have been no redemption. And if Christ had not risen from the dead, or have
      broken the bands of death, that the grave should have no victory, and that death should have
      no sting, there could have been no resurrection. But there is a resurrection, therefore the
      grave hath no victory, and the sting of death, is swallowed up in Christ: He is the light and
      the life of the world; yea, a light that is endless, that can never be darkened; yea, and also
      a life which is endless, that there can be no more death. Even this mortal shall put on
      immortality, and this corruption shall put on incorruption, and shall be brought to stand
      before the bar of God, to be judged of him according to their works, whether they be good or
      whether they be evil. If they be good, to the resurrection of endless life and happiness, and
      if they be evil, to the resurrection of endless damnation; being delivered up to the devil,
      who hath subjected them which is damnation; having gone according to their own carnal wills
      and desires; having never called upon the Lord while the arms of mercy was extended towards
      them; for the arms of mercy was extended towards them, and they would not; they being warned
      of their iniquities, and yet they would not depart from them; and they were commanded to
      repent, and yet they would not repent. And now had ye not ought to tremble and repent of your
      sins, and remember only in and through Christ ye can be saved? Therefore, if ye teach the law
      of Moses, also teach that it is a shadow of those things which are to come; teach them that
      redemption cometh through Christ the Lord, which is the very Eternal Father. Amen. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that when Abinadi had finished these sayings, that the king
      commanded that the priests should take him and cause that he should be put to death. But there
      was one among them, whose name was Alma, he also being a descendant of Nephi. And he was a
      young man, and he believed the words which Abinadi had spoken, for he knew concerning the
      iniquity which Abinadi had testified against them: Therefore he began to plead with the king
      that he would not be angry with Abinadi, but suffer that he might depart in peace. But the
      king was more wroth, and caused that Alma should be cast out from among them, and sent his
      servants after him, that they might slay him. But he fled from before them, and hid himself,
      that they found him not. And he, being concealed for many days, did write all the words which
      Abinadi had spoken. And it came to pass that the king caused that his guards should surround
      Abinadi, and take him; and they bound him and cast him into prison. And after three days,
      having counselled with his priests, he caused that he should again be brought before him. And
      he said unto him, Abinadi, we have found an accusation against thee, and thou art worthy of
      death. For thou hast said that God himself should come down among the children of men; and now
      for this cause thou shalt be put to death, unless thou wilt recall all the words which thou
      hast spoken evil concerning me and my people. Now Abinadi saith unto him: I say unto you, I
      will not recall the words which I have spoken unto you concerning this people, for they are
      true; and that ye may know of their surety, I have suffered myself that I have fallen into
      your hands. Yea, and I will suffer even until death, and I will not recall my words, and they
      shall stand as a testimony against you. And if ye slay me, ye will shed innocent blood, and
      this shall also stand as a testimony against you at the last day. And now king Noah was about
      to release him, for he feared his word; for he feared the judgment of God would come upon him.
      But the priests lifted up their voices against him, and began to accuse him, saying: He hath
      reviled the king. Therefore the king was stirred up in anger against him, and he delivered him
      up, that he might be slain. And it came to pass that they took him, and bound him, and
      scourged his skin with faggots, yea, even unto death. And now when the flames began to scorch
      him, he cried unto them saying: Behold, even as ye have done unto me, so shall it come to pass
      that thy seed shall cause that many shall suffer the pains that I do suffer, even the pains of
      death, by fire; and this because they believe in the salvation of the Lord their God. And it
      will come to pass that ye shall be afflicted with all manner of diseases, because of your
      iniquities. Yea, and ye shall be smitten on every hand, and shall be driven and scattered to
      and fro, even as a wild flock is driven by wild and ferocious beasts. And in that day ye shall
      be hunted, and ye shall be taken by the hand of your enemies, and then ye shall suffer, as I
      suffer, the pains of death, by fire. Thus God executeth vengeance upon those that destroy his
      people. O God, receive my soul. And now when Abinadi had said these words, he fell, having
      suffered death by fire; yea, having been put to death because he would not deny the
      commandments of God: having sealed the truth of his words by his death. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that Alma, who had fled from the servants of king Noah, repented
      of his sins and iniquities, and went about privately among the people, and began to teach the
      words of Abinadi; yea, concerning that which was to come, and also concerning the resurrection
      of the dead, and the redemption of the people, which was to be brought to pass through the
      power, and sufferings, and death of Christ, and his resurrection and ascension into Heaven.
      And as many as would hear his word he did teach. And he taught them privately, that it might
      not come to the knowledge of the king. And many did believe his words. And it came to pass
      that as many as did believe him, did go forth to a place which was called Mormon, having
      received its name from the king, being in the borders of the land having been infested, by
      times, or at seasons, by wild beasts. Now there was in Mormon a fountain of pure water, and
      Alma resorted thither, there being near the water a thicket of small trees, where he did hide
      himself in the day-time, from the searches of the king. And it came to pass that as many as
      believed him, went thither to hear his words. And it came to pass after many days, there were
      a goodly number gathered together to the place of Mormon, to hear the words of Alma. Yea, all
      were gathered together that believed on his word, to hear him. And he did teach them, and did
      preach unto them repentance, and redemption, and faith on the Lord. And it came to pass that
      he said unto them, Behold, here is the waters of Mormon; for thus were they called. And now,
      as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing
      to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light; yea, and are willing to mourn with
      those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as
      witnesses of God at all times, and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even
      until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first
      resurrection, that ye may have eternal life: Now I say unto you, if this be the desires of
      your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before
      him that ye have entered into a covenant with him that ye will serve him and keep his
      commandments, that he may pour out his spirit more abundantly upon you. --And now when the
      people had heard these words, they clapped their hands for joy and exclaimed. This is the
      desires of our hearts. And now it came to pass that Alma took Helam, he being one of the
      first, and went and stood forth in the water, and cried, saying, O Lord, pour out your spirit
      upon thy servant, that he may do this work with holiness of heart. And when he had said these
      words, the spirit of the Lord was upon him, and he said, Helam, I baptize thee, having
      authority from the Almighty God, as a testimony that ye have entered into a covenant to serve
      him until you are dead, as to the mortal body; and may the spirit of the Lord be poured out
      upon you; and may he grant unto you eternal life, through the redemption of Christ, which he
      hath prepared from the foundation of the world. And after Alma had said these words, both Alma
      and Helam was buried in the water; and they arose and came forth out of the water rejoicing,
      being filled with the spirit. And again, Alma took another, and went forth a second time into
      the water, and baptizing him according to the first, only he did not bury himself again in the
      water. And after this manner he did baptize every one that went forth to the place of Mormon;
      and they were in number about two hundred and four souls; yea, and they were baptized in the
      waters of Mormon, and were filled with the grace of God: and they were called the Church of
      God, or the Church of Christ, from that time forward. And it came to pass that whosoever was
      baptized by the power and authority of God, they was added to his church. And it came to pass
      that Alma, having authority from God, ordained priests; even one priests to every fifty of
      their number did he ordain to preach unto them, and to teach them concerning the things
      pertaining to the kingdom of God. And he commanded them that they should teach nothing save it
      were the things which he had taught, and which had been spoken by the mouths of the holy
      prophets. Yea, even he commanded them that they should preach nothing save it were repentance
      and faith on the Lord, who hath redeemed his people. And he commanded them that there should
      be no contention one with another, but that they should look forward with one eye, having one
      faith and one baptism; having their hearts knit together in unity and in love, one towards
      another. And thus he commanded them to preach. And thus they became the children of God. And
      he commanded them that they should observe the sabbath day, and keep it holy, and also every
      day they should give thanks to the Lord their God. And he also commanded them that the priests
      which he had ordained should labor with their own hands for their support; and there was one
      day in every week that was set apart that they should gather themselves together to teach the
      people, and worship the Lord their God, and also as often as it was in their power to assemble
      themselves together. And the priests was not to depend upon the people for their support; but
      for their labor they were to receive the grace of God, that they might wax strong in spirit,
      having the knowledge of God, that they might teach the power and authority from God. And again
      Alma commanded that the people of the Church should impart of their substance, every one
      according to that which he hath; if he have more abundantly, he should impart more abundantly;
      and he that hath but little, but little should be required; and to him that doth not should be
      given. And thus they should impart of their substance, of their own free will and good desires
      towards God, and to those priests that stood in need, yea, and to every needy, naked soul. And
      this he said unto them, having been commanded of God; and they did walk uprightly before God,
      imparting to one another, both temporally and spiritually, according to their needs and their
      wants. And now it came to pass that all this was done in Mormon; yea, by the waters of Mormon,
      in the forest that was near the waters of Mormon, yea, the place of Mormon, the waters of
      Mormon, the forest of Mormon, how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the
      knowledge of their redeemer; yea, and how blessed are they, for they shall sing to his praise
      forever. And these things were done in the borders of the land, that they might not come to
      the knowledge of the king. But behold, it came to pass that the king, having discovered a
      movement among the people, sent his servants to watch them. Therefore on the day that they
      were assembling themselves together to hear the word of the Lord, they were discovered unto
      the king. And now the king saith that Alma was stirring up the people to a rebellion against
      him; therefore he sent his army to destroy them. And it came to pass that Alma, and the people
      of the Lord were apprised of the coming of the king's army; therefore they took their tents
      and their families, and departed into the wilderness. And they were in number about four
      hundred and fifty souls. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that the army of the king returned, having searched in vain for the
      people of the Lord. And now behold, the forces of the king were small, having been reduced,
      and there began to be a division among the remainder of the people. And the lesser part began
      to breath out threatnings against the king, and there began to be a great contention among
      them. And now there was a man among them whose name was Gideon, and he being a strong man, and
      an enemy to the king, therefore he drew his sword and swore his wrath, that he would slay the
      king. And it came to pass that he fought with the king; and when the king saw that he was
      about to overpower him, he fled and ran and got upon the tower, which was near the temple. And
      Gideon pursued after him and was about to get upon the tower to slay the king, and the king
      cast his eyes round about towards the land of Shemlon, and behold, the army of the Lamanites
      were within the borders of the land. And now the king cried out in the anguish of his soul,
      saying, Gideon, spare me, for the Lamanites are upon us, and they will destroy them; yea, they
      will destroy my people. And now the king was not so much concerned about his people, as he was
      about his own life; nevertheless, Gideon did spare his life. And the king commanded the people
      that they should flee before the Lamanites, and he himself did go before them, and they did
      flee into the wilderness with their women and their children. And it came to pass that the
      Lamanites did pursue them, and did overtake them, and began to slay them. Now it came to pass
      that the king commanded them that all men should leave their wives and their children, and
      flee from the Lamanites. Now there were many that would not leave them, but had rather stay
      and perish with them. And the rest left their wives and their children and fled. And it came
      to pass that those that tarried with their wives and their children, caused that their fair
      daughters should stand forth and plead with the Lamanites, that they would not slay them. And
      it came to pass that the Lamanites had compassion on them, for they were charmed with the
      beauty of their women; therefore the Lamanites did spare their lives, and took them captives,
      and carried them back to the land of Nephi, and granted unto them that they might possess the
      land, under the conditions that they would deliver up the king Noah unto the hands of the
      Lamanites, and deliver up their property, even one half of all they possessed; one half of
      their gold, and their silver, and all their precious things; and thus they should pay tribute
      to the king of the Lamanites, from year to year. And now there was one of the sons of the king
      among those that was taken captive, whose name was Limhi. And now Limhi was desirous that his
      father should not be destroyed; nevertheless, Limhi was not ignorant of the iniquities of his
      father, he himself, being a just man. And it came to pass that Gideon sent men into the
      wilderness secretly, to search for the king, and those that was with him. And it came to pass
      that they met the people in the wilderness, all save the king and his priests. Now they had
      sworn in their hearts that they would return to the land of Nephi, and if their wives and
      their children were slain, and also those that had tarried with them, that they would seek
      revenge, and also perish with them. And the king commanded them that they should not return;
      and they were angry with the king, and caused that he should suffer, even unto death by fire.
      And they were about to take the priests also and put them to death, and they fled before them.
      And it came to pass that they were about to return to the land of Nephi, and they met the men
      of Gideon. And the men of Gideon told them of all that had happened to their wives and their
      children; and that the Lamanites had granted unto them that they might possess the land by
      paying a tribute to the Lamanites of one half of all they possessed. And the people told the
      men of Gideon that they had slain the king, and his priests had fled from them farther into
      the wilderness, And it came to pass that after they had ended the ceremony, that they returned
      to the land of Nephi, rejoicing, because their wives and their children were not slain; and
      they told Gideon what they had done to the king. And it came to pass that the king of the
      Lamanites made an oath unto them, that his people should not slay them. And also Limhi, being
      the son of the king, having the kingdom conferred upon him by the people, made an oath unto
      the king of the Lamanites, that his people should pay tribute unto him, even one half of all
      they possessed. And it came to pass that Limhi began to establish the kingdom, and to
      establish peace among his people. And the king of the Lamanites set guards round about the
      land, that he might keep the people of Limhi in the land, that they might not depart into the
      wilderness; and he did support his guards out of the tribute which he did receive from the
      Nephites. And now king Limhi did have continual peace in his kingdom, for the space of two
      years, that the Lamanites did not molest them nor seek to destroy them. </text>

    <text> Now there was a place in Shemlon, where the daughters of the Lamanites did gather
      themselves together for to sing, to dance, and to make themselves merry. And it came to pass
      that there was one day a small number of them gathered together to sing and dance. And now the
      priests of the king Noah, being ashamed to return to the city of Nephi, yea, and also fearing
      that the people would slay them, therefore they durst not return to their wives and their
      children. And having tarried in the wilderness and having discovered the daughters of the
      Lamanites, they laid and watched them; and when there were but few of them gathered together
      to dance, they came forth out of their secret places, and took them and carried them into the
      wilderness; yea, twenty and four of the daughters of the Lamanites they carried into the
      wilderness. And it came to pass that when the Lamanites found that their daughters had been
      missing, they were angry with the people of Limhi; for they thought it was the people of
      Limhi. Therefore they sent their armies forth; yea, even the king himself went before his
      people; and they went up to the land of Nephi, to destroy the people of Limhi. And now Limhi
      had discovered them from the tower; even all their preparations for war did he discover;
      therefore he gathered his people together, and laid wait for them in the fields, and in the
      forests. And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had come up, that the people of Limhi
      began to fall upon them from their waiting places, and began to slay them. And it came to pass
      that the battle became exceeding sore, for they fought like lions for their prey. And it came
      to pass that the people of Limhi began to drive the Lamanites before them, yet they were not
      half so numerous as the Lamanites. But they fought for their lives, and for their wives, and
      for their children; therefore they exerted themselves, and like dragons did they fight. And it
      came to pass that they found the king of the Lamanites among the number of their dead; yet he
      was not dead, having been wounded and left upon the ground, so speedy was the flight of his
      people. And they took him and bound up his wounds, and brought him before Limhi, and said,
      Behold, here is the king of the Lamanites; he having received a wound, hath fallen among their
      dead, and they have left him; and behold, we have brought him before you; and now let us slay
      him. But Limhi saith unto them, Ye shall not slay him, but bring him hither, that I may see
      him. And they brought him. And Limhi saith unto him, What cause have ye to come up to war
      against my people? Behold, my people have not broken the oath that I made unto you; therefore,
      why should ye break the oath which ye made unto my people? And now the king said, I have
      broken the oath, because thy people did carry away the daughters of my people; therefore in my
      anger I did cause my people to come up to war against thy people. Now Limhi had heard nothing
      concerning this matter; therefore he saith, I will search among my people, and whosoever hath
      done this thing shall perish. Therefore he caused a search to be made among his people. Now
      when Gideon had heard these things, he being the king's captain, he went forth and said unto
      the king, I pray thee forbear, and do not search this people, and lay not this thing to their
      charge. For do ye not remember the priests of thy father, which this people sought to destroy?
      And are they not in the wilderness? And is it not they which have stolen the daughters of the
      Lamanites? And now behold, and tell the king these things, that he may tell his people, that
      they may be pacified towards us: for behold, they are already preparing to come against us;
      and behold also, there are but few of us. And behold, they come with their numerous hosts; and
      except the king doth pacify them towards us, we must perish. For are not the words of Abinadi
      fulfilled, which he prophesied against us? and all this because we would not hearken unto the
      words of the Lord, and turn from our iniquities? And now let us pacify the king, and we fulfil
      the oath which we have made unto him: for it is better that we should be in bondage, than that
      we should lose our lives; therefore, let us put a stop to the shedding of so much blood. And
      now Limhi told the king all the things concerning his father, and the priests that had fled
      into the wilderness, and attributed the carrying away of their daughters to them. And it came
      to pass that the king was pacified towards his people; and he said unto them, Let us go forth
      to meet my people, without arms; and I swear unto you with an oath, that my people shall not
      slay thy people. And it came to pass that they followed the king, and went forth without arms
      to meet the Lamanites. And it came to pass that they did meet the Lamanites; and the king of
      the Lamanites did bow himself down before them, and did plead in behalf of the people of
      Limhi. And when the Lamanites saw the people of Limhi, that they were pacified towards them,
      and returned with their king in peace to their own land. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that Limhi and his people returned to the city of Nephi, and began to
      dwell in the land again in peace. And it came to pass that after many days, the Lamanites
      began to be stirred up in anger against the Nephites; and they began to come into the borders
      of the land round about. Now they durst not slay them, because of the oath which their king
      had made unto Limhi; but they would smite them on their cheeks, and exercise authority over
      them; and began to put heavy burdens upon their backs, and drive them as they would a dumb
      ass: yea, all this was done, that the word of the Lord be fulfilled. And now the afflictions
      of the Nephites was great; and there was no way that they could deliver themselves out of
      their hands, for the Lamanites had surrounded them on every side. And it came to pass that the
      people began to murmur with the king, because of their afflictions; and they began to be
      desirous to go against them to battle. And they did afflict the king sorely with their
      complaints; therefore he granted unto them that they should do according to their desires. And
      they gathered themselves together again, and put on their armor, and went forth against the
      Lamanites, to drive them out of their land. And it came to pass that the Lamanites did beat
      them, and drove them back, and slew many of them. And now there was a great mourning and
      lamentation among the people of Limhi; the widow mourning for her husband; the son and the
      daughter mourning for their father; and the brothers for their brethren. Now there were a
      great many widows in the land; and they did cry mightily from day to day, for a great fear of
      the Lamanites had come upon them. And it came to pass that their continual cries did stir up
      the remainder of the people of Limhi to anger, against the Lamanites. And they went again to
      battle; but they were driven back again, suffering much loss. Yea, they went again, even the
      third time, and suffered in the like manner; and those that were not slain, returned again to
      the city of Nephi. And they did humble themselves even to the dust, subjecting themselves to
      the yoke of bondage, submitting themselves to be smitten, and to be driven to and fro, and
      burdened, according to the desires of their enemies. And they did humble themselves even in
      the depths of humility; and they did cry mightily to God; yea, even all the day long did they
      cry unto their God, that he would deliver them out of their afflictions. And now the Lord was
      slow to hear their cry, because of their iniquities; nevertheless the Lord did hear their
      cries, and began to soften the hearts of the Lamanites, that they began to ease their burdens:
      yet the Lord did not see fit to deliver them out of bondage. And it came to pass that they
      began to prosper by degrees in the land, and began to raise grain more abundantly, and flocks,
      and herds, that they did not suffer with hunger. Now there was a great number of women more
      than there was of men; therefore king Limhi commanded every man should impart to the support
      of the widows and their children, that they might not perish with hunger: and this they did,
      because of the greatness of their number that had been slain. Now the people of Limhi kept
      together in a body as mush as it was possible, and secure their grain, and their flocks; and
      the king himself did not trust his person without the walls of the city, unless he took his
      guards with him, fearing that he might by some means fall into the hands of the Lamanites. And
      he caused that his people should watch the land round about, that by some means they might
      take those priests that fled into the wilderness, which had stolen the daughters of the
      Lamanites, and that caused such a great destruction to come upon them; for they were desirous
      to take them, that they might punish them: for they had come into the land of Nephi by night,
      and carried off of their grain, and many of their precious things; therefore they laid wait
      for them. And it came to pass that there was no more disturbance between the Lamanites and the
      people of Limhi, even until the time that Ammon and his brethren came into the land. And the
      king having been without the gates of the city with his guard he discovered Ammon and his
      brethren; and supposing them to be priests of Noah, therefore he caused that they should be
      taken, and bound, and cast into prison. And had they been the priests of Noah, he would have
      caused that they should be put to death; but when he found that they were not, but that they
      were his brethren, and had come from the land of Zarahemla, he was filled with exceeding great
      joy. --Now king Limhi had sent, previous to the coming of Ammon, a small number of men to
      search for the land of Zarahemla; but they could not find it: and they were lost in the
      wilderness. Nevertheless they did find a land which had been peopled; yea, a land which was
      covered with dry bones; yea, a land which had been peopled, and which had been destroyed; and
      they having supposed it to be the land of Zarahemla, returned to the land of Nephi, having
      arrived in the borders of the land not many days before the coming of Ammon. And they brought
      a record with them, even a record of the people whose bones they had found; and they were
      engraven on plates of ore. And now Limhi was again filled with joy, on learning from the mouth
      of Ammon that king Benjamin had a gift from God, whereby he could interpret such engravings;
      yea, and Ammon also did rejoice. Yet Ammon and his brethren were filled with sorrow, because
      so many of his brethren had been slain; and also that king Noah and his priests had caused the
      people to commit so many sins and iniquities against God; and they also did mourn for the
      death of Abinadi; and also for the departure of Alma, and the people that went with him, who
      had formed a church of God through the strength and power of God, and faith on the words which
      had been spoken by Abinadi; yea, they did mourn for their departure, for they knew not whither
      they had fled. Now they would have gladly joined with them, for they themselves had entered
      into a covenant with God, to serve him, and keep his commandments. And now since the coming of
      Ammon, king Limhi had also entered into a covenant with God, and also many of his people, to
      serve him, and keep his commandments. And it came to pass that king Limhi and many of his
      people was desirous to be baptized; but there was none in the land that had authority from
      God. And Ammon declined doing this thing, considering himself an unworthy servant; therefore
      they did not at that time form themselves into a church, waiting upon the spirit of the Lord.
      Now they were desirous to become even as Alma and his brethren, which had fled into the
      wilderness. They were desirous to be baptized, as a witness and a testimony that they were
      willing to serve God with all their hearts; nevertheless they did prolong the time: and an
      account of their baptism shall be given hereafter. And now all the study of Ammon and his
      people, and king Limhi and his people, was to deliver themselves out of the hands of the
      Lamanites, and from bondage. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that Ammon and king Limhi began to consult with the people how
      they should deliver themselves out of bondage; and even they did cause that all the people
      should gather themselves together: and this they did that they might have a voice of the
      people concerning the matter. And it came to pass that they could find no way to deliver
      themselves out of bondage, except it were to take their women and children, and their flocks,
      and their herds, and their tents, and depart into the wilderness; for the Lamanites being so
      numerous that it was impossible for the people of Limhi to contend with them, thinking to
      deliver themselves out of bondage by the sword. Now it came to pass that Gideon went forth and
      stood before the king, and said unto him, Now O king, thou hast hitherto hearkened unto my
      words many times when we have been contending with our brethren, the Lamanites. And now O
      king, if thou hast not found me to be a unprofitable servant or if thou hast hitherto listened
      to my words in any degree, and they have been of service to thee, even so I desire that thou
      wouldst listen to my words at this time, and I will be thy servant, and deliver this people
      out of bondage. And the king granted unto him that he might speak. And Gideon saith unto him,
      Behold the back pass through the back wall, on the back side of the city. The Lamanites, or
      the guards of the Lamanites, by night, are drunken; therefore let us send a proclamation among
      all this people, that they gather together their flocks and herds, that they may drive them
      into the wilderness by night. And I will go according to thy command, and pay the last tribute
      of wine to the Lamanites, and they will be drunken; and we will pass through the secret pass
      on the left of the camp, when they are drunken and asleep: thus we will depart with our women
      and our children, our flocks and our herds, into the wilderness; and we will travel around the
      land of Shilom. And it came to pass that the king hearkened unto the words of Gideon. And it
      came to pass that king Limhi caused that his people should gather their flocks together; and
      he sent the tribute of wine to the Lamanites; and he also sent more wine, as a present unto
      them: and they did drink freely of the wine which king Limhi did send unto them. And it came
      to pass that the people of king Limhi did depart by night into the wilderness with their
      flocks and their herds; and they went round about the land of Shilom in the wilderness, and
      bent their course towards the land of Zarahemla, being led by Ammon and his brethren. And they
      had taken all their gold, and silver, and their precious things, which they could carry; and
      also their provisions with them, into the wilderness; and they pursued their journey. And
      after being many days in the wilderness, they arrived in the land of Zarahemla, and joined his
      people, and became his subjects. And it came to pass that Mosiah received them with joy; and
      he also received their records, and also the records which had been found by the people of
      Limhi. And now it came to pass when the Lamanites had found that the people of Limhi had
      departed out of the land by night, that they sent an army into the wilderness to pursue them;
      and after they had pursued them two days, they could no longer follow their tracks; therefore
      they were lost in the wilderness. </text>

    <text> Now Alma, having been warned of the Lord that the armies of king Noah would come upon
      them, and had made it known to his people, therefore they gathered together their flocks and
      took of their grain, and departed into the wilderness before the armies of king Noah. And the
      Lord did strengthen them, that the people of king Noah could not overtake them, to destroy
      them. And it came to pass that they fled eight days' journey into the wilderness. And they
      came to a land, yea, even a very beautiful and pleasant land; a land of pure water. And it
      came to pass that they pitched their tents, and began to till the ground, and began to build
      buildings, &amp;c; yea, they were industrious, and did labor exceedingly. And it came to
      pass that the people were desirous that Alma should be their king, for he was beloved by his
      people. But he saith unto them, Behold, it is not expedient that we should have a king; for
      thus saith the Lord: Ye shall not esteem one flesh above another; or one man shall not think
      himself above another; therefore I say unto you, It is not expedient that ye should have a
      king. Nevertheless, if it were possible that ye could always have just men to be your kings,
      it would be well for you to have a king. But remember the iniquity of king Noah and his
      priests: and I myself was caught in a snare, and did many things which was abominable in the
      sight of the Lord, which caused me sore repentance; nevertheless, after much tribulation, the
      Lord did hear my cries, and did answer my prayers, and hath made me an instrument in his
      hands, in bringing so many of you to a knowledge of his truth. Nevertheless, in this I do not
      glory, for I am unworthy to glory of myself. And now I say unto you, As ye have been oppressed
      by king Noah, and have been in bondage to him and his priests, and have been brought into
      iniquity by them; therefore ye were bound with the hands of iniquity. And now as ye have been
      delivered, by the power of God, out of these bonds; yea, even out of the hands of king Noah
      and his people, and also from the bonds of iniquity, even so I desire that ye should stand
      fast in this liberty wherewith ye have been made free, and that ye trust no man to be king
      over you; and also trusting no one to be your teachers nor your ministers, except he be a man
      of God, walking in his ways and keeping his commandments. Thus did Alma teach his people, that
      every man should love his neighbor as himself; that there should be no contention among them.
      And now Alma was their high priest, he being a founder of their Church. And it came to pass
      that none received authority to preach or to teach, except it were by him from God. Therefore
      he consecrated all their priests, and all their teachers, and none were consecrated except it
      were just men. Therefore they did watch over their people, and did nourish them with things
      pertaining to righteousness. And it came to pass that they began to prosper exceedingly in the
      land; and they called the land Helam. And it came to pass that they did multiply and prosper
      exceedingly in the land of Helam; and they built a city, which they called Helam. Nevertheless
      the Lord seeth fit to chasten his people; yea, he trieth their patience and their faith.
      Nevertheless, whosoever puteth his trust in him, the same shall be lifted up at the last day.
      Yea, and thus it was with this people. For behold, I will shew unto you that they were brought
      into bondage, and none could deliver them but the Lord their God; yea, even the God of
      Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. And it came to pass that he did deliver them, and he did shew
      forth his might power unto them, and great was their rejoicings. For behold, it came to pass
      that while they were in the land of Helam, yea, in the city of Helam, while tilling the land
      round about, behold an army of the Lamanites were in the borders of the land. Now it came to
      pass that the brethren of Alma fled from the fields, and gathered themselves together into the
      city of Helam; and they were much frightened because of the appearance of the Lamanites. But
      Alma went forth and stood among them, and exhorted them that they should not be frightened,
      but they should remember the Lord their God, and he would deliver them; therefore they hushed
      their fears, and began to cry unto the Lord, that he would soften the hearts of the Lamanites,
      that they would spare them, and their wives, and their children. And it came to pass that the
      Lord did soften the hearts of the Lamanites. And Alma and his brethren went forth and
      delivered themselves up into their hands; and the Lamanites took possession of the land of
      Helam. Now the armies of the Lamanites which had followed after the people of king Limhi, had
      been lost in the wilderness for many days. And behold, they had found those priests of king
      Noah, in a place called Amulon; and they began to possess the land of Amulon, and had began to
      till the ground. Now the name of the leader of those priests was Amulon. And it came to pass
      that Amulon did plead with the Lamanites; and he also sent forth their wives, which was the
      daughters of the Lamanites, to plead with their brethren, that they should not destroy their
      husbands. And it came to pass that the Lamanites had compassion on Amulon and his brethren,
      and did not destroy them, because of their wives. And Amulon and his brethren did join the
      Lamanites, and they were travelling in the wilderness in search of the land of Nephi, when
      they discovered the land of Helam, which was possessed by Alma and his brethren. And it came
      to pass that the Lamanites promised unto Alma and his brethren, that if they shewed them the
      way which led to the land of Nephi, that they would grant unto them their lives and their
      liberty. But it came to pass that after Alma had shewn them the way that led to the land of
      Nephi, the Lamanites would not keep their promise; but they set guards round about the land of
      Helam, over Alma and his brethren. And the remainder of them went to the land of Nephi, and a
      part of them returned to the land of Helam, and also brought with them the wives and the
      children of the guards which had been left in the land. And the king of the Lamanites had
      granted unto Amulon that he should be a king and a ruler over his people, which was in the
      land of Helam; nevertheless he should have no power to do any thing contrary to the will of
      the king of the Lamanites. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that Amulon did gain favor in the eyes of the king of the Lamanites;
      therefore the king of the Lamanites granted unto him and his brethren, that they should be
      appointed teachers over his people; yea, even over the people which was in the land of
      Shemlon, and in the land of Shilom, and in the land of Amulon: for the Lamanites had taken
      possession of all these lands; therefore the king of the Lamanites had appointed kings over
      all these lands. And now the name of the king of the Lamanites was Laman, being called after
      the name of his father; and therefore he was called king Laman. And he was king over a
      numerous people; and he appointed teachers of the brethren of Amulon, in every land which was
      possessed by his people: and thus the language of Nephi began to be taught among all the
      people of the Lamanites. And they were a people friendly one with another; nevertheless they
      knew not God; neither did the brethren of Amulon teach them any thing concerning the Lord
      their God, neither the law of Moses; nor did they teach them the words of Abinadi; but they
      taught them that they should keep their record, and that they might write one to another. And
      thus the Lamanites began to increase in riches, and began to trade one with another, and wax
      great, and began to be a cunning and a wise people, as to the wisdom of the world; yea, a very
      cunning people; delighting in all manner of wickedness and plunder, except it were among their
      own brethren. And now it came to pass that Amulon began to exercise authority over Alma and
      his brethren, and began to persecute him and cause that his children should persecute their
      children: for Amulon knew Alma, that he had been one of the king's priests, and that it was he
      that believed the words of Abinadi, and was driven out before the king; and therefore he was
      wroth with him, for he was subject to king Laman; yet he exercised authority over them, and
      put tasks upon them, and put task-masters over them. And it came to pass that so great was
      their afflictions, that they began to cry mightily to God. And it came to pass that Amulon
      commanded them that they should stop their cries; and he put guards over them to watch them,
      that whosoever should be found calling upon God, should be put to death. And it came to pass
      that Alma and his people did not raise their voices to the Lord their God, but did pour out
      their hearts to him; and he did know the thoughts of their hearts. And it came to pass that
      the voice of the Lord came to them in their afflictions, saying, Lift up your heads and be of
      good comfort, for I know of the covenant which ye have made unto me; and I will covenant with
      my people, and deliver them out of bondage. And I will also ease the burdens which is put upon
      your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage;
      and this will I do, that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a
      surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions. And now it came to pass
      that the burdens which was laid upon Alma and his brethren, were made light; yea, the Lord did
      strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit
      cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord. And it came to pass that so great
      was their faith and their patience, that the voice of the Lord came unto them saying, Be of
      good comfort, for on the morrow I will deliver thee out of bondage. And he saith unto Alma,
      Thou shalt go before this people, And I will go with thee, and deliver this people out of
      bondage. And he saith unto Alma: Thou shalt go before this people, and I will go with thee,
      and deliver this people out of bondage. Now it came to pass that Alma and his people, in the
      night time, gathered their flocks together, and also their grain; yea, even all the night time
      were they gathering their flocks together. And in the morning the Lord caused a deep sleep to
      come upon the Lamanites, yea, and all their task-masters were in a profound sleep. And it came
      to pass that Alma and his people departed into the wilderness; and when they had travelled all
      day, they pitched their tents in a valley, and they called the valley Alma, because he led
      their way in the wilderness; yea, and in the valley of Alma they poured out their thanks to
      God because he had been merciful unto them, and eased their burdens, and had delivered them
      out of bondage; for they were in bondage, and none could deliver them, except it were the Lord
      their God. And they gave thanks to God, yea, all their men, and all their women, and all their
      children, that could speak, lifted their voices in the praises of their God. And now the Lord
      said unto Alma, Haste thee and get thou and this people out of this land, for the Lamanites
      have awoke and doth pursue thee; therefore get thee out of this land, and I will stop the
      Lamanites in this valley, that they come no further in pursuit of this people. And it came to
      pass that they departed out of the valley, and took their journey into the wilderness. And it
      came to pass that after they had been in the wilderness twelve days, they arrived to the land
      of Zarahemla; and king Mosiah did also receive them with joy. </text>

    <text> And now king Mosiah caused that all the people be gathered together. Now there were not
      so many of the children of Nephi, or so many of those descendants of Nephi, as they were of
      the people of Zarahemla, which was a descendant of Mulok, and those which came with him into
      the wilderness; and there were not so many of the people of Nephi and of the people of
      Zarahemla as there was of the Lamanites; yea, they were not half so numerous. And now all the
      people of Nephi was assembled together, and also all the people of Zarahemla, and they were
      gathered together in two bodies. And it came to pass that Mosiah did read, and caused to be
      read, the records of Zeniff to his people; yea, he read the records of the people of Zeniff,
      from the time they left the land of Zarahemla until the time they returned again. And he also
      read the account of Alma and his brethren, and all their afflictions, from the time they left
      the land of Zarahemla, until the time they returned again. And now when Mosiah had made an end
      of reading the records, his people which had tarried in the land was struck with wonder and
      amazement, for they knew not what to think;, for when they beheld those that had been
      delivered out of bondage, they were filled with exceeding great joy. And again, when they
      thought of their brethren which had been slain by the Lamanites, they were filled with sorrow,
      and even shed many tears of sorrow. And again, when they thought of the immediate goodness of
      God, and his power in delivering Alma and his brethren out of the hands of the Lamanites, and
      of bondage, they did raise their voices, and gave thanks to God. And again when they thought
      upon the Lamanites, which was their brethren, of their sinful and polluted state, they were
      filled with pain and anguish, for the welfare of their souls. And it came to pass that when
      those which were the children of Amulon and his brethren, which had taken to wife the
      daughters of the Lamanites, they were displeased with the conduct of their fathers, and they
      would not longer be called by the names of their fathers; therefore they took upon themselves
      the name of Nephi, that they might be called the children of Nephi, and be numbered among
      those which were called Nephites. And now all the people of Zarahemla were numbered with the
      Nephites, and this because the kingdom had been conferred upon none but those which were the
      descendants of Nephi. And now it came to pass that when Mosiah had made an end of speaking and
      reading to the people, he desired that Alma should also speak to the people. And it came to
      pass that Alma did speak unto them, when they were assembled together in large bodies, and he
      went from one body to another, preaching unto the people repentance and faith on the Lord. And
      he did exhort the people of Limhi and his brethren, all these that had been delivered out of
      bondage, that they should remember that it was the Lord that did deliver them. And it came to
      pass that after Alma had taught the people many things, and had made an end of speaking to
      them, the king Limhi was desirous that he might be baptized; and all his people were desirous
      that they might be baptized also. Therefore Alma did go forth into the water, and did baptize
      them; yea, he did baptize them after the manner he did his brethren in the waters of Mormon;
      yea, and as many as he did baptize did belong to the Church of God; and this because of their
      belief on the words of Alma. And it came to pass that king Mosiah granted unto Alma, that he
      might establish Churches throughout all the land of Zarahemla; and gave him power to ordain
      priests and teachers over every Church. Now this was done because there was so many people
      that they could not all be governed by one teacher; neither could they all hear the word of
      God in one assembly; therefore they did assemble themselves together in different bodies,
      being called Churches; every Church having their priests and their teachers, and every priest
      preaching the word according as it was delivered to him by the mouth of Alma: and thus,
      notwithstanding there being many Churches, they were all one Church; yea, even the Church of
      God: for there was nothing preached in all the Churches except it were repentance and faith in
      God. And now there was seven Churches in the land of Zarahemla. And it came to pass that
      whosoever was desirous to take upon them the name of Christ, or of God, they did join the
      churches of God; and they were called the people of God. And the Lord did pour out his spirit
      unto them, and they were blest, and prospered in the land. </text>

    <text> Now it came to pass that there was many of the rising generation that could not
      understand the words of king Benjamin, being little children at the time he spake unto his
      people; and they did not believe the tradition of their fathers. They did not believe what had
      been said concerning the resurrection of the dead; neither did they believe concerning the
      coming of Christ. And now because of their belief, they could not understand the word of God;
      and their hearts were hardened. And they would not be baptized; neither would they join the
      church. And they were a separate people as to their faith, and remained so ever after, even in
      their carnal and sinful state: for they would not call upon the Lord their God. --``And now in
      the reign of Mosiah, they were not half so numerous as the people of God but because of the
      dissentions among the brethren, they became more numerous. For it came to pass that they did
      deceive many with their flattering words, which were in the church, and did cause them to
      commit many sins; therefore it became expedient that those who committed sin that was in the
      church, should be admonished by the church. And it came to pass that they were brought before
      the priests, and delivered up unto the priests by the teachers; and the priests brought them
      before Alma, which was the high priest. Now king Mosiah had given Alma the authority over the
      church. And it came to pass that Alma did not know concerning them, for there were many
      witnesses against them; yea, the people stood and testified of their iniquity in abundance.
      Now there had not any such thing happened before, in the church; therefore Alma was troubled
      in his spirit, and he caused that they should be brought before the king. And he saith unto
      the king, Behold, here are many which we have brought before thee, which are accused of their
      brethren; yea, and they have been taken in divers iniquities. And they do not repent of their
      iniquities; therefore we have brought them before thee, that thou may judge them according to
      their crimes. But king Mosiah saith unto Alma, Behold, I judge them not; therefore I deliver
      them into thy hands to be judged. And now the spirit of Alma was again troubled; and he went
      and inquired of the Lord what he should do concerning this matter, for he feared that he
      should do wrong in the sight of God. And it came to pass that after he had poured out his
      whole soul to God, the voice of the Lord came to him, saying, Blessed art thou, Alma; and
      blessed are they which were baptized in the waters of Mormon. Thou art blessed because of thy
      exceeding faith in the words alone my servant Abinadi. And blessed are they, because of their
      exceeding faith in the words alone which thou hast spoken unto them. And blessed are thou
      because thou hast established a church among this people; and they shall be established, and
      they shall be my people. Yea, blessed is this people, which is willing to bear my name: for in
      my name shall they be called; and they are mine. And because thou hast inquired of me
      concerning the transgressor, thou art blessed. Thou art my servant; And I covenant with thee,
      that thou shall have eternal life; and thou shalt serve me, and go forth in my name, and shall
      gather together my sheep. And he that will hear my voice, shall be my sheep; and him shall ye
      receive into the church; and him will I also receive. For behold, this is my church; whosoever
      that is baptized, shall be baptized unto repentance. And whosoever ye receive, shall believe
      in my name; and him will I freely forgive: for it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the
      world; for it is I that hath created them; and it is I that granteth unto him that believe in
      the end, a place at my right hand. For behold, in my name are they called; and if they know
      me, they shall come forth, and shall have a place eternally at my right hand. And it shall
      come to pass that when the second trump shall sound, then shall they that never knew me come
      forth, and shall stand before me; and then shall they know that I am the Lord their God, that
      I am their Redeemer; but they would not be redeemed. And then will I confess unto them, that I
      never knew them; and they shall depart into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his
      angels. Therefore I say unto you, That he that will not hear my voice, the same shall ye not
      receive into my church, for my voice, the same shall ye not receive into my church, for him I
      will not receive at the last day; therefore I say unto you, Go; and whosoever transgresseth
      against me, him shall ye judge according to the sins which he hath committed; and if he
      confess his sins before thee and me, and repenteth in the sincerity of his heart, him shall ye
      forgive, and I will forgive him also; yea, and as often as my people repent, will I forgive
      them their trespasses against me. And ye shall also forgive one another your trespasses: for
      verily I say unto you, He that forgiveth not his neighbor's trespasses, when he saith that he
      repenteth, the same hath brought himself under condemnation. Now I say unto you, Go; and
      whosoever will not repent of his sins, the same shall not be numbered among my people; and
      this shall be observed from this time forward. And it came to pass when Alma had heard these
      words, he wrote them down, that he might have them, and that he might judge the people of that
      church, according to the commandments of God. And it came to pass that Alma went and judged
      those that had been taken in iniquity, according to the word of the Lord. And whosoever
      repenteth of their sins and did confess them, them he did number among the people of the
      church; and them that would not confess their sins and repent of their iniquity, the same were
      not numbered among the people of the church, and their names were blotted out. And it came to
      pass that Alma did regulate all the affairs of the church; and they began to have peace, and
      to prosper exceedingly in the affairs of the church; walking circumspectly before God;
      receiving many and baptizing many. And now all these things did Alma and his fellow-laborers
      do, which were over the church; walking in all diligence; teaching the word of God in all
      things; suffering all manner of afflictions; being persecuted by all those who did not belong
      to the church of God. And they did admonish their brethren; and they were also admonished,
      everyone, by the word of God, according to his sins, or to the sins which he had committed;
      being commanded of God to pray without ceasing, and to give thanks in all things. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that the persecutions which was inflicted on the church by the
      unbelievers, became so great, that the church began to murmur, and complain to their leaders
      concerning the matter; and they did complain to Alma. And Alma laid the case before their
      king, Mosiah. And Mosiah consulted with his priests. And it came to pass that king Mosiah sent
      a proclamation throughout the land round about, that there should not any unbeliever persecute
      any of those which belonged to the church of God; and there was a strict command throughout
      all the churches, that there should be no persecutions among them; that there should be an
      equality among all men; that they should let no pride nor haughtiness disturb their peace;
      that every man should esteem his neighbor as himself, laboring with their own hands for their
      support; yea, and all their priests and teachers should labor with their own hands for their
      support, in all cases save it were in sickness, or in much want: and doing these things, they
      did abound in the grace of God. And there began to be much peace again in the land; and the
      people began to be very numerous, and began to scatter abroad upon the face of the earth; yea,
      on the north and on the south, on the east and on the west, building large cities and villages
      in all quarters of the land. And the Lord did visit them and prosper them, and they became a
      large and a wealthy people. Now the sons of Mosiah was numbered among the unbelievers; and
      also one of the sons of Alma was numbered among them, he being called Alma, after his father;
      nevertheless he became a very wicked and idolatrous man. And he was a man of many words, and
      did speak much flattery to the people; therefore he led many of the people to do after the
      manner of his iniquities. And he became a great hinderment to the prosperity of the church of
      God; stealing away the hearts of the people; causing much dissention among the people; giving
      a chance for the enemy of God to exercise his power over them. And now it came to pass that
      while he was going out about to destroy the church of God: for he did go about secretly with
      the sons of Mosiah, seeking to destroy the church, and to lead astray the people of the Lord,
      contrary to the commandments of God, or even the king; and as I said unto you, as they were
      going about rebelling against God, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto them; and he
      descended as it were in a cloud; and he spake as it were with a voice of thunder, which caused
      the earth to shake upon which they stood; and so great was their astonishment, that they fell
      to earth, and understood not the words which he spake unto them. Nevertheless he cried again,
      saying, Alma, arise, and stand forth, for why persecuteth thou the church of God? For the Lord
      hath said, This is my church, and I will establish it; and nothing shall overthrow it, save it
      is the transgression of my people. And again: The angel saith, Behold, the Lord hath heard the
      prayers of his people and also the prayers of his servant Alma, which is thy father: for he
      hath prayed with much faith concerning thee, that thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of
      the truth; therefore for this purpose have I come to convince thee of the power and authority
      of God, that the prayers of his servants might be answered according to their faith. And now
      behold, can ye dispute the power of God? For behold, doth not my voice shake the earth? And
      can ye not also behold me before you? And I am sent from God. --Now I say unto thee, Go, and
      remember the captivity of thy fathers in the land of Helam, and in the land of Nephi; and
      remember how great things he hath done for them: for they were in bondage, and he hath
      delivered them. And now I say unto thee, Alma, Go thy way, and seek to destroy the church no
      more, that their prayers may be answered, and this even if thou wilt of thyself be cast off.
      And now it came to pass that these were the last words which the angel spake unto Alma, and he
      departed. And now Alma, and those that were with him, fell again to the earth, for great was
      their astonishment: for with their own eyes they had beheld an angel of the Lord; and his
      voice was as thunder, which shook the earth; and they knew that there was nothing save the
      power of God, that should shake the earth and cause it to tremble, as though it would part
      asunder. And now the astonishment of Alma was so great, that he became dumb, that he could not
      open his mouth; yea, and he became weak, even that he could not move his hands; therefore he
      was taken by those that were with him, and carried helpless, even until he was laid before his
      father. And they rehearsed unto his father all that had happened unto them; and his father
      rejoiced, for he knew that it was the power of God. And he caused that a multitude should be
      gathered together, that they might witness what the Lord had done for his son, and also for
      those that were with him. And he caused that the priests should assemble themselves together;
      and they began to fast, and to pray to the Lord their God, that he would open the mouth of
      Alma, that he might speak; and also that his limbs might receive their strength, that the eyes
      of the people might be opened to see and know of the goodness and glory of God. And it came to
      pass after that they fasted and prayed for the space of two days and two nights, the limbs of
      Alma received their strength, and he stood up and began to speak unto them, bidding them to be
      of good comfort: for, said he, I have repented of my sins, and have redeemed of the Lord;
      behold, I am born of the spirit. And the Lord said unto me, Marvel not that all mankind, yea,
      men, and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea, born of
      God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed
      of God, becoming his sons and daughters; and thus they become new creatures; and unless they
      do this, they can in no wise inherit the kingdom of God. I say unto you, unless this be the
      case, they must be cast off: and this I know, because I was like to be cast off. Nevertheless,
      after wandering through much tribulation, repenting nigh unto death, the Lord in mercy hath
      seen fit to snatch me out of an everlasting burning, and I am born of God; my soul hath been
      redeemed from the gall of bitterness and bonds of iniquity. I was in the darkest abyss; but
      now I behold the marvellous light of God. My soul was wrecked with eternal torment; but I am
      snatched, and my soul is pained no more. I rejected my Redeemer, and denied that which had
      been spoken of by our fathers; but now that they may foresee that he will come, and that he
      remembereth every creature of his creating, and he will make himself manifest unto all; yea,
      every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess before him. Yea, even at the last day, when all
      men shall stand to be judged of him, than shall they confess that he is God; then shall they
      confess, who live without God in the world, that the judgment of an everlasting punishment is
      just upon them; and they shall quake, and tremble, and shrink beneath the glance of his
      all-searching eye. And now it came to pass that Alma began from this time forward, to teach
      the people, and those which were with Alma at the time the angel appeared unto them;
      travelling round about through all the land, publishing to all the people the things which
      they had heard and seen, and preaching the word of God in much tribulation, being greatly
      persecuted by those which were unbelievers, being smitten by many of them; but notwithstanding
      all this, they did impart much consolation to the church, confirming their faith, and
      exhorting them with long suffering and much travail, to keep the commandments of God. And four
      of them were sons of Mosiah; and their names were Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni:
      these were the names of the sons of Mosiah. And after they had travelled throughout all the
      land of Zarahemla, and among all the people which was under the reign of king Mosiah,
      zealously striving to repair all the injuries which they had done to the church; confessing
      all their sins, and publishing all the things which they had seen, and explaining the
      prophecies and the scriptures to all who desired to hear them: and thus they were instruments
      in the hands of God, in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth, yea, to the knowledge of
      their redeemer. And how blessed they are! For they did publish peace; they did publish good
      tidings of good; and they did declare unto the people that the Lord reigneth. </text>

    <text> Now it came to pass that after the sons of Mosiah had done all these things, they took a
      small number with them, and returned to their father, the king, and desired of him that he
      would grant unto them, that they might, with these whom they had selected, go up to the land
      of Nephi, that they might preach the things which they had heard, and that they might impart
      the word of God to their brethren, the Lamanites, that perhaps they might bring them to the
      knowledge of the Lord their God, and convince them of the iniquity of their fathers; and that
      perhaps they might cure them of their hatred towards the Nephites, that they might also be
      brought to rejoice in the Lord their God, that they might become friendly to one another, and
      that there should be no more contentions in all the land which the Lord their God hath given
      them. Now they were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they
      could not bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul
      should endure endless torment, did cause them to quake and tremble. And thus did the spirit of
      the Lord work upon them, for they were the very vilest of sinners. And the Lord saw fit in his
      infinite mercy to spare them; nevertheless they suffered much anguish of soul, because of
      their iniquities; and suffering much, fearing that they should be cast off forever. And it
      came to pass that they did plead with their father many days, that they might go up to the
      land of Nephi. And it came to pass that king Mosiah went and inquired of the Lord, if he
      should let his sons go up among the Lamanites to preach the word. And the Lord said unto
      Mosiah, Let them go up, for many shall believe on their words, and they shall have eternal
      life; and I will deliver thy sons out of the hands of the Lamanites. And it came to pass that
      Mosiah granted that they might go, and do according to their request; and they took their
      journey into the wilderness, to go up to preach the word among the Lamanites: and I shall give
      an account of their proceedings hereafter. Now king Mosiah had no one to confer the kingdom
      upon, for there was not any of his sons which would accept of the kingdom; therefore he took
      the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, and also the plates of Nephi, and
      all the things which he had kept and preserved, according to the commandments of God, and
      after having translated and caused to be written the records which were on the plates of gold,
      which had been found by the people of Limhi, which was delivered to him by the hand of Limhi:
      and this he done, because of the great anxiety of his people. for they were desirous beyond
      measure, to know concerning those people which had been destroyed. And now he translated them
      by the means of those two stones which was fastened into the rims of a bow. Now these things
      was prepared from the beginning, and was handed down from generation to generation, for the
      purpose of interpreting languages; and they have been kept and preserved by the hand of the
      Lord, that he should discover to every creature which should possess the land, the iniquities
      and abominations of his people: and whosoever has these things, is called seer, after the
      manner of old times. Now after Mosiah had finished translating these records, behold, it gave
      an account of the people which was destroyed, from the time they were destroyed, back to
      building of the great tower, at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people; and
      they were scattered abroad upon the face of all the earth, yea, and even from that time until
      the creation of Adam. Now this account did cause the people of Mosiah to mourn exceedingly;
      yea, they were filled with sorrow; nevertheless it gave them much knowledge in the which they
      did rejoice. And this account shall be written hereafter: for behold, it is expedient that all
      people should know these things which are written in this account. And now I said unto you,
      that after king Mosiah had done these things, he took the plates of brass, and all the things
      which he had kept, and conferred them upon Alma, which was the son of Alma; yea, all the
      records, and also the interpreters, and conferred them upon him, and commanding him that he
      should keep and preserve them, and also keep a record of the people, handing them down from
      one generation to another, even as they had been handed down from the time that Lehi left
      Jerusalem. </text>

    <text> Now when Mosiah had done this, he sent out throughout all the land, among all the people,
      desiring to know their will concerning who should be their king. And it came to pass that the
      voice of the people came, saying: We are desirous that Aaron, thy son, should be our king, and
      our ruler. Now Aaron had gone up to the land of Nephi, therefore the king could not confer the
      kingdom upon him; neither would Aaron take upon him the kingdom; neither was any of the sons
      of Mosiah willing to take upon them the kingdom; therefore king Mosiah sent again among the
      people, yea, even a written word sent he among the people. And these were the words that were
      written, saying: Behold, O ye my people, or my brethren for I esteem you as such; for I desire
      that ye should consider the cause which ye are called to consider; for ye are desirous to have
      a king. Now I declare unto you, that he to whom the kingdom doth rightly belong, hath
      declined, and will not take upon him the kingdom. And now if there should be another appointed
      to his stead, behold I fear there would rise contentions among you; and who knoweth but what
      my son, to whom the kingdom doth belong, should turn to be angry, and draw away a part of this
      people after him, which would cause wars and contentions among you; which would be the cause
      of shedding much blood, and perverting the way of the Lord; yea, and destroy the souls of much
      people. Now I say unto you, let us be wise and consider these things, for we have no right to
      destroy my son, neither should we have any right to destroy another, if he should be appointed
      in his stead. And if my son should turn again to his pride and vain things, he would recall
      the things which he had said, and claim his right to the kingdom, which would cause him and
      also this people to commit much sin. And now let us be wise, and look forward to these things,
      and do that which will make for the peace of this people. Therefore I will be your king the
      remainder of my days; nevertheless, let us appoint judges to judge this people according to
      our law, and we will newly arrange the affairs of this people; for we will appoint wise men to
      be judges, that will judge this people according to the commandments of God. Now it is better
      that a man be judged of God than of man, for the judgments of God are always just; therefore,
      if it were possible that ye could have just men to be your kings, which would establish the
      laws of God, and judge this people according to his commandments; yea, if ye could have men
      for kings, which would do even as my father Benjamin did for this people; I say unto you, if
      this could always be the case, then it would be expedient that ye should always have kings to
      rule over you. And even I, myself have labored with all the power and faculties which I have
      possessed, to teach you the commandments of God, and to established peace throughout the land,
      that there should be no wars nor contentions, no stealing, nor plundering, nor murdering, nor
      no manner of iniquity; and whosoever hath committed iniquity, him have I punished according to
      the crime which he hath committed, according to the law which hath been given to us by our
      fathers. Now I say unto you, that because all men are not just, it is not expedient that ye
      should have a king or kings to rule over you. For behold, how much iniquity doth one wicked
      king cause to be committed! yea, and what great destruction! --Yea, remember king Noah, his
      wickedness and abominations of his people. Behold what great destruction did come upon them;
      and also because of their iniquities, they were brought into bondage. And were it not for the
      interposition of their all-wise Creator, and this because of their sincere repentance, they
      must unavoidably remained in bondage until now. But behold, he did deliver them because they
      did humble themselves before him; and because they cried mightily unto him, he did deliver
      them out of bondage: and thus doth the Lord work with his power in all cases among the
      children of men, extending the arm of mercy towards them that put their trust in him. And
      behold, now I say unto you, Ye cannot dethrone an iniquitous king, save it be through much
      contention and the shedding of much blood. For behold, he hath his friends in iniquity, and he
      keepeth his guards about him; and he teareth up the laws of these which have reigned in
      righteousness before him; and he trampleth under his feet the commandments of God; and he
      enacted laws, and sendeth them forth among his people; yea, laws after the manner of his own
      wickedness; and whosoever doth not obey his laws, he causeth to be destroyed; and whosoever
      doth rebel against him, he will send his armies against them in war, and if he can, he will
      destroy them: and thus an unrighteous king doth pervert the ways of all righteousness. And now
      behold I say unto you, It is expedient that such abominations should come upon you; therefore
      choose you by the voice of this people, judges, that ye may be judged according to the laws
      which hath been given you by our fathers, which are correct, and which was given them by the
      hand of the Lord. Now it is not common that the voice of the people desireth any thing
      contrary to that which is right; but it is common for the lesser part of the people to desire
      that which is not right; therefore this shall ye observe, and make it your law to do business
      by the voice of the people. And if the time cometh that the voice of the people doth choose
      iniquity, then is the time that the judgments of God will come upon you; yea, then is the time
      he will visit you with great destruction, even as he hath hitherto visited this land. And now
      if ye have judges, and they do not judge you according to the law which has been given, ye can
      cause that they may be judged of a higher judge; if your higher judges doth not judge
      righteous judgments, ye shall cause that a small number of your lower judges should be
      gathered together, and they shall judge your higher judges, according to the voice of the
      people. And I command you to do these things in the fear of the Lord; and I command you to do
      these things, and that ye have no king: that if these people commit sins and iniquities, they
      shall be answered upon their own heads. For behold I say unto you, The sins of many people
      have been caused by iniquities of their kings; therefore iniquities are answered upon the
      heads of their kings. And now I desire that this inequality should be no more in this land,
      especially among this my people; but I desire that this land be a land of liberty, and every
      man may enjoy his rights and priveleges alike, so long as the Lord seeth fit, that we may live
      and inherit the land; yea, even as long as any of our posterity remaineth upon the face of the
      land. And many more things did king Mosiah write unto them, unfolding unto them all the trials
      and troubles of a righteous king; yea, all the travails of soul for their people, and also all
      the murmurings of the people to their king; and he explained it all unto them. And he told
      them that these things had not ought to be; but that the burdens should come upon all the
      people, that every man might bear his part. And he also unfolded unto them all the
      disadvantages they labored under, by having an unrighteous king to rule over them; yea, all
      his iniquities and abominations, and all the wars, and contentions, and blood-shed, and the
      stealing, and the plundering, and the committing of whoredoms, and all manner of iniquities,
      which cannot be enumerated; telling them that these things ought not to be; that they was
      expressly repugnant to the commandments of God. And now it came to pass, after king Mosiah had
      sent these things forth among the people, they were convinced of the truth of his words;
      therefore they relinquished their desire for a king, and became exceedingly anxious that every
      man should have an equal chance throughout all the land; yea, and every man expressed a
      willingness to answer for his own sins. Therefore it came to pass that they assembled
      themselves together in bodies throughout the land, to cast in their voices concerning who
      should be their judges, to judge them according to the law which had been given them; and they
      were exceedingly rejoiced, because of the liberty which had been granted unto them. And they
      did wax strong in love towards Mosiah; yea, they did esteem him more than any other man: for
      they did not look upon him as a tyrant, who was seeking for gain, yea, for that lucre which
      doth corrupt the soul, for he had not exacted riches of them, neither did he delight in the
      shedding of blood; but he had established peace in the land, and he had granted unto his
      people that they should be delivered from all manner of bondage; therefore they did esteem
      him, yea, exceedingly, beyond measure. And it came to pass that they did appoint judges to
      rule over them, or to judge them according to the law; and this they done throughout all the
      land. And it came to pass that Alma was appointed to be the chief judge; he being also the
      high priest; his father having conferred the office upon him, and had given him the charge
      concerning all the affairs of the church. And now it came to pass that Alma did walk in the
      ways of the Lord, and he did keep his commandments, and he did judge righteous judgments; and
      there was continual peace through the land; and thus commenced the reign of the judges
      throughout all the land of Zarahemla, among all the people which was called the Nephites: and
      Alma was the first and chief judge. And now it came to pass that his father died, being eighty
      and two years old, having lived to fulfil the commandments of God. And it came to pass that
      Mosiah died also, in the thirty and third year of his reign, being sixty and three years old;
      making in the whole, five hundred and nine years from the time Lehi left Jerusalem; and thus
      ended the reign of the kings over the people of Nephi; and thus ended the days of Alma, who
      was the founder of their church. </text>

    <text> Now it came to pass that in the first year of the reign of the Judges over the people of
      Nephi, from this time forward, king Mosiah having gone the way of all the earth, having warred
      a good warfare, walking uprightly before God, leaving none to reign in his stead; nevertheless
      he established laws, and they were acknowledged by the people; therefore they were obliged to
      abide by the laws which he had made. And it came to pass that in the first year of the reign
      of Alma in the judgment seat, there was a man brought before him to be judged; a man which was
      large, and was noted for his much strength; and he had gone about among the people, preaching
      to them that which he termed to be the word of God, bearing down against the church; declaring
      unto the people that every priest and teacher had ought to become popular; and they ought not
      to labor with their own hands, but they had ought to be supported by the people; and he also
      testified unto the people that all mankind should be saved at the last day, and that they need
      not fear or tremble, but they might lift up their heads and rejoice: for the Lord had created
      all men, and had also redeemed all men; and in the end, all men should have eternal life. And
      it came to pass that he did teach these things so much, that many did believe on his words,
      even so many that they began to support him and give him money; and he began to be lifted up
      in the pride of his heart, and to wear very costly apparel; yea, and even began to establish a
      church, after the manner of his preaching. And it came to pass as he was going to preach to
      those who believed on his word, he met a man which belonged to the church of God, yea, even
      one of their teachers; and he began to contend with him sharply, that he might lead away the
      people of the church; but the man withstood him, admonishing him with the words of God. Now
      the name of the man was Gideon; and it was him that was an instrument in the hands of God, in
      delivering the people of Limhi out of bondage. --Now because Gideon withstood him with the
      words of God, he was wroth with Gideon, and drew his sword and began to smite him. Now Gideon
      being stricken with many years, therefore he was able to withstand his blows, therefore he was
      slain by the sword; and the man who slew him was taken by the people of the church, and was
      brought before Alma, to be judged according to the crime which he had committed. And it came
      to pass that he stood before Alma, and plead for himself with much boldness. But Alma said
      unto him, Behold, this is the first time that priestcraft has been introduced among this
      people. And behold, thou art not only guilty of priestcraft, but hast endeavored to enforce
      among this people, it would prove their entire destruction. And thou hast shed the blood of a
      righteous man, yea, a man which has done much good among this people; and were we to spare
      thee, his blood would come upon us for vengeance; therefore thou art condemned to die,
      according to the law which has been given us by Mosiah, our last king; and they have been
      acknowledged by this people; therefore this people must abide by the law. And it came to pass
      that they took him; and his name was Nehor; and they carried him upon the top of the hill
      Manti, and there he was caused, or rather did acknowledge, between the heavens and the earth,
      that what we had taught to the people was contrary to the word of God; and there he suffered
      an ignominious death. Nevertheless this did not put an end to the spreading of priestcraft
      through the land: for there was many which loved the vain things of the world, and they went
      forth preaching false doctrines; and this they did for the sake of riches and honor.
      Nevertheless they durst not lie, if it were known, for fear of the law, for liars were
      punished; therefore they pretended to preach according to their belief: and now the law could
      have no power on any man for their belief. And they durst not steal, for fear of the law; for
      such were punished; neither durst they rob, nor murder: for he that murdered was punished unto
      death. But it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the Church of God, began to
      persecute those that did belong to the Church of God, and had taken upon them the name of
      Christ; yea, they did persecute them, and afflict them with all manner of words, and this
      because of their humility; because they were not proud in their own eyes, and because they did
      impart the word of God, one with another, without money and without price. Now there was a
      strict law among the people of the Church, that there should not any man, belonging to the
      Church, arise and persecute those that did not belong to the Church, and that there should be
      no persecution among themselves. Nevertheless, there were many among them who began to be
      proud, and began to contend warmly with their adversaries, even unto blows; yea, they would
      smite one another with their fists. Now this was in the second year of the reign of Alma, and
      it was a cause of much affliction to the Church; yea, it was the cause of much trial with the
      Church; for the hearts of many were hardened, and their names were blotted out, that they were
      remembered no more among the people of God. And also many withdrew themselves from among them.
      Now this was a great trial to those that did stand fast in faith; nevertheless, they were
      steadfast and immoveable in keeping the commandments of God, and they bore with patience the
      persecution which was heaped upon them. And now when the priests left their labor, to impart
      the word of God unto the people, the people also left their labors to hear the word of God.
      And when the priest had imparted unto them the word of God, they all returned again diligently
      unto their labors; and the priest, not esteeming himself above his hearers; for the preacher
      was no better than the hearer, neither was the teacher any better than the learner: and thus
      they were all equal and they did all labor, every man according to his strength; and they did
      impart of their substance every man according to that which he had, to the poor, and the
      needy, and the sick, and the afflicted; and they did not wear costly apparel, yet they were
      neat and comely: and thus they did establish the affairs of the Church: and thus they began to
      have continual peace again, notwithstanding all their persecutions. And now because of the
      steadiness of the Church, they began to be exceeding rich; having abundance of all things
      whatsoever they stood in need; an abundance of flocks, and herds, and fatlings of every kind,
      and also abundance of grain, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious things; and abundance
      of silk and fine twined linen, and all manner of good homely cloth. And thus in their
      prosperous circumstances they did not send away any which was naked, or that was hungry, or
      that was athirst, or that was sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their
      hearts upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and
      free, both male and female, whether out of the Church or in the Church, having no respects to
      persons as to those who stood in need; and thus they did prosper and become far more wealthy,
      than those who did not belong to their Church. For those who did not belong to their Church,
      did indulge themselves in sorceries, and in idolatry or idleness, and in bablings, and in
      envyings and strife; wearing costly apparel; being lifted up in the pride of their own eyes;
      lying, thieving, robbing, commiting whoredoms, and murdering, and all manner of wickedness;
      nevertheless, the law was put in force upon all those who did transgress it, inasmuch as it
      were possible. And it came to pass that by thus exercising the law upon them, every man
      suffering according to that which he had done, they became more still, and durst not commit
      any wickedness, if it were known; therefore, there was much peace among the people of Nephi,
      until the fifth year of the reign of the judges. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass in the commandment of the fifth year of their reign, there began to
      be a contention among the people, for a certain man, being called Amlici; he being a very
      cunning man, yea, a wise man, as to the wisdom of the world; he being after the order of the
      man that slew Gideon by the sword, who was executed according to the law. Now this Amlici had,
      by his cunning, drawn away much of the people after him; even so much that they began to be
      very powerful; and they began to endeavor to establish Amlici to be a king over the people.
      Now this was alarming to the people of the Church, and also to all those that had not been
      drawn away after the persuasions of Amlici: for they knew that according to their law that
      such things must be established by the voice of the people; therefore, if it were possible
      that Amlici should gain the voice of the people, he being a wicked man, would deprive them of
      their rights and privileges of the Church, &amp;c: for it was his intent to destroy the
      Church of God. And it came to pass that the people assembled themselves together throughout
      all the land, every man according to his mind, whether it were for or against Amlici, in
      separate bodies, having much dispute and wonderful contentions one with another: and thus they
      did assemble themselves together, to cast their voices concerning the matter: and they were
      laid before the judges. And it came to pass that the voice of the people came against Amlici,
      that he was not made king over the people. Now this did cause much joy in the hearts of those
      which were against him; but Amlici did stir up those which were in his favor, to anger against
      those which were not in his favor. And it came to pass that they gathered themselves together,
      and did consecrate Amlici to be their king. Now when Amlici was made king over them, he
      commanded them that they should take up arms against their brethren; and this he done, that he
      might subject them to him. Now the people of Amlici were distinguished by the name of Amlici,
      being called Amlicites; and the remainder were called Nephites, or the people of God;
      therefore the people of the Nephites was aware of the intent of the Amlicites, and therefore
      they did prepare for to meet them; yea, they did arm themselves with swords, and with
      cimeters, and with bows, and with arrows, and with stones, and with slings, and with all
      manner of weapons of war, of every kind; and thus they were prepared to meet the Amlicites at
      the time of their coming. And there was appointed captains, and higher captains, and chief
      captains, according to their numbers. And it came to pass that Amlici did arm his men with all
      manner of weapons of war, of every kind; and he also appointed rulers and leaders over his
      people, to lead them to war against their brethren. And it came to pass that the Amlicites
      came up upon the hill Amnihu, which was east of the river Sidon, which ran by the land of
      Zarahemla, and there they began to make war with the Nephites. Now Alma, he being the chief
      judge, and the governor of the people of Nephi therefore he went up with his people, yea, with
      his captains, and chief captains, yea, at the head of his armies, against the Amlicites to
      battle; and they began to slay the Amlicites upon the hill east of Sidom. And the Amlicites
      did contend with the Nephites with great strength, insomuch that many of the Nephites did fall
      before the Amlicites; nevertheless the Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they
      slew the Amlicites with a great slaughter, that they began to flee before them. And it came to
      pass that the Nephites did pursue the Amlicites all that day, and did slay them with much
      slaughter, insomuch that there was slain of the Amlicites twelve thousand five hundred thirty
      two souls; and there was slain of the Nephites, six thousand five hundred sixty and two souls.
      And it came to pass that when Alma could pursue the Amlicites no longer, he caused that his
      people should pitch their tents in the valley of Gideon, the valley being called after that
      Gideon, which was slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword; and in this valley the Nephites
      did pitch their tents for the night. And Alma sent spies to follow the remnant of the
      Amlicites, that he might know of their plans and their plots, whereby he might guard himself
      against them, that he might prepare his people from being destroyed. Now those which he had
      sent out to watch the camp of the Amlicites, were called Zeram, and Amnor, and Manti, and
      Limher; these were they which went out with their men to watch the camp of the Amlicites. And
      it came to pass that on the morrow they returned into the camp of the Nephites, in great
      haste, being greatly astonished, and struck with much fear, saying, Behold, we followed the
      camp of the Amlicites, and to our great astonishment, in the land of Minon, above the land of
      Zarahemla, in the course of the land of Nephi, we saw numerous hosts of the Lamanites; and
      behold the Amlicites have joined them, and they are upon our brethren in that land; and they
      are fleeing before them with their flocks, and their wives, and their children, towards our
      city; and except we make haste, they obtain possession of our city; and our fathers, and our
      wives, and our children be slain. And it came to pass that the people of Nephi took their
      tents, and departed out of the valley of Gideon towards their city, which was the city of
      Zarahemla. And behold, as they were crossing the river Sidon, the Lamanites and the Amlicites
      being as numerous almost, as it were, as the sands of the sea, came upon them to destroy them;
      nevertheless the Nephites being strengthened by the hand of the Lord, having prayed mightily
      to him that he would deliver them out of the hands of their enemies; therefore the Lord did
      hear their cries, and did strengthen them, and the Lamanites and the Amlicites did fall before
      them. And it came to pass that Alma fought with Amlici with the sword, face to face; and they
      did contend mightily, one with another. And it came to pass that Alma, he being a man of God,
      being exercised with much faith, and he cried, saying, O Lord, have mercy and spare my life,
      that I may be an instrument in thy hands, to save and preserve this people. Now when Alma had
      said these words, he contended with Amlici; and he was strengthened, insomuch that he slew
      Amlici with the sword. And he also contended with the king of the Lamanites; but the king of
      the Lamanites fled back from before Alma, and sent his guards to contend with Alma. But Alma,
      with his guards, contended with the guards of the king of the Lamanites, until he slew and
      drove them back; and thus he cleared the ground, or rather the bank, which was on the west
      side of the river Sidon, throwing bodies of the Lamanites which had been slain, into the
      waters of Sidon, that thereby his people might have room to cross and contend with the
      Lamanites and the Amlicites, on the west side of the river Sidon. And it came to pass that
      when they had all crossed the river Sidon, that the Lamanites and the Amlicites began to flee
      before them, notwithstanding they were so numerous that they could not be numbered; and they
      fled before the Nephites, towards the wilderness which was west and north, away beyond the
      borders of the land; and the Nephites did pursue them with their might, and did slay them;
      yea, they were met on every hand, and slain, and driven, until they were scattered on the
      west, and on the north, until they had reached the wilderness, which was called Hermounts, and
      it was that part of the wilderness which was infested by wild and ravenous beasts. And it came
      to pass that many died in the wilderness of their wounds, and were devoured by those beasts,
      and also the vultures of the air; and their bones have been found, and have been heaped up on
      the earth. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that the Nephites, which were not slain by the weapons of war, after
      having buried those which had been slain: now the number of the slain were not numbered
      because of the greatness of their number; and after they had finished burying their dead, they
      all returned to their lands, and to their houses, and their wives, and their children. Now
      many women and children had been slain with the sword, and also many of their flocks and their
      herds; and also many of their fields of grain were destroyed, for they were trodden down by
      the hosts of men. And now as many of the Lamanites and the Amlicites which had been slain upon
      the bank of the river Sidon, were cast into the waters of Sidon; and behold, their bones are
      in the depths of the sea, and they are many. And the Amlicites were distinguished from the
      Nephites, for they had marked themselves with red in their foreheads, after the manner of the
      Lamanites; nevertheless they had not shorn their heads like unto the Lamanites. Now the heads
      of the Lamanites were shorn; and they were naked, save it were skin, which was girded about
      their loins, and also their armour, which was girded about them, and their bows, and their
      arrows, and their stones, and their slings, &amp;c. And the skins of the Lamanites were
      dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them
      because of their transgression and their rebellion against their brethren, which consisted of
      Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph, and Sam, which were just and holy men. And their brethren sought to
      destroy them; therefore they were cursed; and the Lord God set a mark upon them, yea, upon
      Laman and Lemuel, and also the sons of Ishmael, and the Ismaelitish women: and this was done,
      that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord
      God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions,
      which would prove their destruction. And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed
      with that of the Lamanites, did bring the same curse upon his seed; therefore whomsoever
      suffered himself to be led away by the Lamanites, were called under the head, and there was a
      mark set upon him. And it came to pass that whosoever would not believe in the tradition of
      the Lamanites, but believed those records which were brought out of the land of Jerusalem, and
      also the tradition of their fathers, which were correct, which believed in the commandments of
      God, and kept them, were called the Nephites, or the people of Nephi, from that time forth;
      and it is they which have kept the records which are true of their people, and also the people
      of Lamanites. Now we will return again to the Amlicites, for they also had a mark set upon
      them; yea, they set the mark upon themselves, yea, even a mark of red upon their foreheads.
      Thus the word of God is fulfilled, for these are the words which he saith to Nephi: Behold,
      the Lamanites have I cursed; and I will set a mark upon them, that they and their seed may be
      separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever, except thy repent of
      their wickedness and turn to me, that I may have mercy upon them. And again: I will set a mark
      upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also. And again: I
      will set a mark upon them that fighteth against thee and thy seed. And again I say, He that
      departeth from thee, shall no more be called thy seed, henceforth and forever: and these were
      the promises of the Lord unto Nephi, and to his seed. Now the Amlicites knew not that they
      were fulfilling the words of God, when they began to mark themselves in their foreheads;
      nevertheless they had come out in open rebellion against God; therefore it was expedient that
      the curse should fall upon them. --Now I would that ye should see that they brought upon
      themselves the curse; and even so doth every man that is cursed, bring upon himself his own
      condemnation. Now it came to pass that not many days after the battle which was fought in the
      land of Zarahemla, by the Lamanites and the Amlicites, that there was another army of the
      Lamanites came in upon the people of Nephi, in the same place where the first army met the
      Amlicites. And it came to pass that there was an army sent to drive them out of their lands.
      --Now Alma himself being afflicted with a wound, did not go up to battle at this time against
      the Lamanites; but he sent up a numerous army against them; and they went up and slew many of
      the Lamanites, and drove the remainder of them out of the borders of their land; and then they
      returned again, and began to establish peace in the land, being troubled no more for a time
      with their enemies. Now all these things were done, yea, all these wars and contentions was
      commenced and ended, in the fifth year of the reign of the Judges; and in one year was
      thousands of souls sent to the eternal world, that they might reap their rewards according to
      their works, whether they were good or whether they were bad, to reap eternal happiness or
      eternal misery, according to the spirit which he listed to obey, whether it be a good spirit
      or a bad one, for every man receiveth wages of him who listeth to obey, and according to the
      words of the spirit of prophecy; therefore let it be according to the truth. And thus ended
      the fifth year of the reign of the Judges. </text>

    <text> Now it came to pass in the sixth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of
      Nephi, there was no contentions nor wars in the land of Zarahemla; and the people being
      afflicted, yea greatly afflicted for the loss of their brethren, and also for the loss of
      their flocks and herds, and also for the loss of their fields of grain, which was trodden
      under foot and destroyed by the Lasmanites, and so great was their afflictions, that every
      soul had cause to mourn; and they believed that it was the judgment of God sent upon them,
      because of their wickedness and their abominations; therefore they were awakened to a
      remembrance of their duty. And they began to establish the church more fully; yea, and many
      were baptized in the water of Sidon, and were joined to the church of God; yea, they were
      baptized by the hand of Alma, who had been consecrated the high priest over the people of the
      church by the hand of his father Alma. And it came to pass in the seventh year of the reign of
      the Judges, there was about three thousand five hundred souls that united themselves to the
      church of God, and were baptized. And thus ended the seventh year of the reign of the Judges
      over the people of Nephi; and there was continual peace in all that time. And it came to pass
      in the eighth year of the reign of the Judges, that the people of the church began to wax
      proud, because of their exceeding riches, and their fine silks, and their fine twined linen,
      and because of many flocks and herds, and their gold, and their silver, and all manner of
      precious things, which they had obtained by their industry; and in all these things were they
      lifted up in pride of their eyes, for they began to wear costly apparel. Now this was the
      cause of much affliction to Alma, yea, and to many of the people which Alma had consecrated to
      be teachers, and priests, and elders, over the church; yea, many of them were sorely grieved
      for the wickedness which they saw had begun to be among their people. For they saw and beheld
      with great sorrow, that the people of the church began to be lifted up in the pride of their
      eyes, and to set their hearts upon riches and upon vain things of the world; that they began
      to be scornful, one towards another, and they began to persecute those that did not believe
      according to their own will and pleasure. And thus in this eighth year of the reign of the
      Judges, there began to be great contentions among the people of the church; yea, there were
      envyings, and strife, and malice, and persecutions, and pride, even to exceed the pride of
      those who did not belong to the church of God. And thus ended the eighth year of the reign of
      Judges; and the wickedness of the church was a great stumbling block to those who did not
      belong to the church; and thus the church began to fail in its progress. And it came to pass
      in the commencement of the ninth year, Alma seeking the wickedness of the church, and seeing
      also that the example of the church began to lead those who were unbelievers, on from one
      piece of iniquity to another, thus bringing on the destruction of the people; yea, seeing
      great inequality among the people, some lifting themselves up with their pride, despising
      others, turning their backs upon the needy, and the naked, and those which were hungry, and
      those which are athirst, and those which were sick and afflicted. Now this was a great cause
      for lamentations among the people, while others were abasing themselves, succoring those who
      stood in need of their succor, such as imparting their substance to the poor and the needy;
      feeding the hungry; and suffering all manner of afflictions, for Christ's sake, which should
      come according to the spirit of prophecy, looking forward to that day, thus retaining a
      remission of their sins; being filled with great joy, because of the resurrection of the dead,
      according to the will, and power, and deliverance of Jesus Christ from the bands of death. And
      now it came to pass that Alma, having seen the afflictions of the humble followers of God, and
      the persecutions which was heaped upon them by the remainder of his people, and seeing all
      their inequality, he began to be very sorrowful; nevertheless the spirit of the Lord did not
      fail him. And he selected a wise man which was among the elders of the church, and gave him
      power according to the voice of the people, that he might have power to enact laws according
      to the laws which had been given, and to put them in force, according to the wickedness and
      the crimes of the people. Now this man's name was Nephihah, and he was appointed Chief Judge;
      and he sat in the judgment seat, to judge and to govern the people. Now Alma did not grant
      unto him the office of being High Priests over the church, but he retained the office of High
      Priest unto himself; but he delivered the judgment seat unto Nephihah: and this he did, that
      he himself might go forth among his people, or among the people of Nephi, that he might preach
      the word of God unto them, to stir them up in remembrance of their duty, and that he might
      pull down, by the word of God, all the pride and craftiness, and all the contentions which was
      among his people, seeing no way that he might reclaim them, save it were in bearing down in
      pure testimony against them. And thus in the commencement of the ninth year of the reign of
      the Judges over the people of Nephi, Alma delivered up the judgment seat to Nephihah, and
      confined himself wholly to the high priesthood of the holy order of God, to the testimony of
      the word, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy. </text>

    <text> Now it came to pass that Alma began to deliver the word of God unto the people, first in
      the land of Zarahemla, and from thence throughout all the land. And these are the words which
      he spake to the people in the Church which was established in the city of Zarahemla, according
      to his own record, saying: I, Alma, having been consecrated by my father Alma, to be a High
      Priest over the Church of God, he having power and authority from God to do these things,
      behold, I say unto you, that he began to establish a Church in the land which was in the
      borders of Nephi; yea, the land which was called the land of Mormon; yea, and he did baptize
      his brethren in the waters of Mormon. And behold, I say unto you, they were delivered out of
      the hands of the people of king Noah, by the mercy and power of God. And behold, after that,
      they were brought into bondage by the hands of the Lamanites, in the wilderness; yea, I say
      unto you, they were in captivity, and again the Lord did deliver them out of bondage by the
      power of his word; and we were brought into this land and here we began to establish the
      Church of God throughout this land, also. And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, you
      that belong to this Church, have you sufficiently retained in remembrance the captivity of
      your fathers? Yea, and have you sufficiently retained in remembrance of his mercy and
      long-suffering towards them? And moreover, have ye sufficiently retained in remembrance that
      he hath delivered their souls from hell? Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awaked them
      out of a deep sleep, and they awoke unto God. Behold, they were in the midst of darkness,
      their souls were illuminated by the light of the everlasting word; yea, they were encircled
      about by the bands of death, and the chains of hell, and an everlasting destruction did await
      them. And now I ask you my brethren, were they destroyed? Behold, I say unto you, nay, they
      were not. And again I ask, was the bands of death broken, and the chains of hell which
      encircled them about, were they loosed? I say unto you, yea, they were loosed, and their souls
      did expand, and they did sing redeeming love. And I say unto you, that they are saved. And now
      I ask of you on what conditions are they saved? Yea, what grounds had they to hope for
      salvation? Yea, and also, the chains of hell? Behold, I can tell you: did not my father Alma
      believe in the words which was delivered by the mouth of Abinadi? And was he not a holy
      prophet? Did he not speak the word of God, and my father Alma believe them? And according to
      his faith there was a mighty change wrought in his heart. Behold I say unto you, that this is
      all true. --And behold, he preached the word unto your fathers, and a mighty change was also
      wrought in their hearts; and they humbled themselves, and put their trust in the true and
      living God. And behold, they were faithful until the end; therefore they were saved. And now
      behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the Church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye
      received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your
      hearts? Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you? Do you look forward
      with an eye of faith, and view this mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption
      raised in incorruption, to stand before God, to be judged according to the deeds which hath
      been done in the mortal body? I say unto you, can you imagine to yourselves that ye hear the
      voice of the Lord, saying unto you, in that day. Come unto me ye blessed, for behold, your
      works have been the works of righteousness upon the face of the earth? Or do ye imagine to
      yourselves that ye can lie unto the Lord in that day, and say, Lord, Our works have been
      righteous works upon the face of the earth, and that he will save you? Or otherwise, can ye
      imagine yourselves brought before the tribunal of God, with your souls filled with guilt and
      remorse; having a remembrance of all your guilt; yea, a perfect remembrance of all your
      wickedness; yea, a remembrance that ye have set at defiance the commandments of God? I say
      unto you, can ye look up to God at that day with a pure heart and clean hands? I say unto you,
      can you look up, having the image of God engraven upon your countenances? I say unto you, can
      ye think of being saved when you have yielded yourselves to become subjects to the Devil? I
      say unto you, ye will know at that day, that ye cannot be saved: for there can no man be saved
      except his garments are washed white; yea, his garments must be purified until they are
      cleansed from all stain, through the blood of him of whom it hath been spoken by our fathers
      which should come to redeem his people from sins. And now I ask of you, my brethren, how will
      any of you feel, if ye shall stand before the bar of God, having your garments stained with
      blood, and all manner of filthiness? Behold, what will these things testify against you?
      Behold, will they not testify that ye are murderers, yea, and also that ye are guilty of all
      manner of wickedness? Behold, my brethren, do ye suppose that such an one can have a place to
      sit down in the Kingdom of God, with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob, and also all the
      holy prophets, whose garments are cleansed, and are spotless, pure and white? I say unto you,
      nay, except ye make our creator a liar from the beginning, or suppose that he is a liar from
      the beginning; or also, ye cannot suppose that such an one can have a place in the kingdom of
      heaven, but they shall be cast out, for they are the children of the kingdom of the Devil. And
      now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye
      have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now? Have ye walked,
      keeping yourselves blameless before God? Could ye say, if ye were called to die at this time,
      within yourselves, that ye have been sufficiently humble? That your garments have been
      cleansed and made white, through the blood of Christ, which will come to redeem his people
      from their sins? Behold, are ye stripped of pride? I say unto you, if ye are not, ye are not
      prepared to meet God. Behold, ye must prepare quickly, for the Kingdom of Heaven is soon at
      hand, and such an one hath not eternal life. Behold, I say, is there one among you who is not
      stripped of envy? I say unto you, that such an one is not prepared, and I would that he should
      prepare quickly, for the hour is close at hand, and he knoweth not when the time shall come:
      for such an one is not found guiltless. And again I say unto you, is there one among you that
      doth make a mock of his brother, or that heapeth upon him persecutions? Wo unto such an one,
      for he is not prepared, and the time is at hand that he must repent, or he cannot be saved;
      yea, even wo unto all ye workers of iniquity; repent, repent, for the Lord hath spoken it.
      Behold, he sendeth an invitation unto all men; for the arms of mercy is extended toward them,
      and he saith, Repent, and I will receive you; yea, he saith, Come unto me and ye shall partake
      of the fruit of the tree of life; yea, ye shall eat and drink, of the bread and the waters of
      life freely; come unto me and bring forth works of righteousness, and ye shall not be hewn
      down and cast into the fire: for behold, the time is at hand that whosoever bringeth forth not
      good fruit, or whosoever doeth not the works of righteousness, the same hath cause to wail and
      mourn. O ye workers of iniquity, ye that are puffed up in the vain things of the world; ye
      that have professed to have known the ways of righteousness; nevertheless ye have gone astray,
      as sheep having no shepherd, notwithstanding a shepherd hath called after you, and art still
      calling after you, but ye will not hearken unto his voice. Behold, I say unto you, that the
      good shepherd doth call you; yea, and in his own name he doth call you, which is the name of
      Christ; and if ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd, to the name by which
      you are called, behold, ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd. And now if ye are not the
      sheep of the good shepherd, of what fold are you? Behold, I say unto you, that the Devil is
      your shepherd, and ye are of his fold; and now who can deny this? Behold, I say unto you,
      whoever denieth this, is a liar and a child of the Devil; for I say unto you, that whosoever
      is good, cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil, cometh from the Devil; therefore, if a man
      bringeth forth good works, he hearkeneth unto the voice of the good shepherd, and he doth
      follow him; but whosoever bringeth forth evil works, the same becometh a child of the Devil:
      for he hearkeneth unto his voice, and doth follow him. And whosoever doeth this must receive
      the wages of him; therefore, for his wages he receiveth death, as to the things pertaining
      unto righteousness, being dead unto all good works. --And now my brethren, I would that ye
      should hear me, for I speak in the energy of my soul; for behold, I have spoken unto you
      plain, that ye cannot err, or have spoken according to the commandments of God. For I am
      called to speak after this manner, according to the holy order of God, which is in Christ
      Jesus; yea, I am commanded to stand and testify unto this people the things which have been
      spoken by our fathers, concerning the things which is to come. And this is not all. Do ye
      suppose that I know not of these things myself? Behold, I testify unto you, that I do know
      that these things whereof I have spoken, are true. And how do ye suppose that I know of their
      surety? Behold, I say unto you, they are made known unto me by the holy spirit of God. Behold,
      I have fasted and prayed many days, that I might know these things myself. And now I do know
      of myself that they are true; for the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his holy
      spirit; and this is the spirit of revelation which is in me. And moreover, I say unto you,
      that as it has thus been revealed unto me, that the words which have been spoken by our
      fathers, are true, even so according to the spirit of prophecy, which is in me, which is also
      by the manifestation of the spirit of God, I say unto you, that I know of myself that
      whatsoever I shall say unto you concerning that which is to come, is true; and I say unto you,
      that I know that Jesus Christ shall come; yea, the Son of the only begotten of the Father,
      full of grace, and mercy, and truth. And behold, it is he that cometh to take away the sins of
      the world; yea, the sins of every man which steadfastly believeth on his name. And now I say
      unto you, that this is the order after which I am called; yea, to preach unto my beloved
      brethren; yea, and every one that dwelleth in the land; yea, to preach unto all, both old and
      young, both bond and free; yea, I say unto you, the aged, and also the middle aged, and the
      rising generation; yea, to cry unto them they must repent and be born again; yea, thus saith
      the spirit, Repent all ye ends of the earth, for the Kingdom of Heaven is soon at hand; yea,
      the Son of God cometh in his glory, in his might, majesty, power and dominion. Yea, my beloved
      brethren, I say unto you, that the spirit saith, Behold, the glory of the King of all the
      earth; and also the King of Heaven shall very soon shine forth among all the children of men;
      and also the spirit saith unto me, yea, crieth unto me with a mighty voice, saying, Go forth
      and say unto this people, repent, for except ye repent ye can in no wise inherit the Kingdom
      of Heaven. And again I say unto you, the spirit saith, Behold, the axe is laid at the root of
      the tree; therefore every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be hewn down and cast
      into the fire; yea, a fire which cannot be consumed; even an unquenchable fire. Behold, and
      remember, the holy one hath spoken it. And now my beloved brethren, I say unto you, can ye
      withstand these sayings; yea, can ye lay aside these things, and trample the holy one under
      your feet; yea, can ye be puffed up in the pride of your hearts; yea, will ye still persist in
      the wearing of costly apparel, and setting your hearts upon the vain things of the world, upon
      your riches; yea, will ye persist in supposing that ye are better one than another; yea, will
      ye persist in the persecutions of your brethren, who humble themselves, and do walk after the
      holy order of God, wherewith they have been brought into this Church, having been sanctified
      by the holy spirit; and they do bring forth works which is meet for repentance; yea, and will
      you persist in turning your backs upon the poor, and the needy, and in withholding your
      substance from them? And finally, all ye that will persist in your wickedness, I say unto you,
      that these are they which shall be hewn down and cast into the fire, except they speedily
      repent. And now I say unto you, all you that are desirous to follow the voice of the good
      shepherd, come ye out from the wicked, and be ye separate, and touch not their unclean things;
      and behold, their names shall be blotted out, that the names of the wicked shall not be
      numbered among the names of the righteous, that the sword of God may be fulfilled, which
      saith, The name of the wicked shall not be mingled with the names of my people. For the names
      of the righteous shall be written in the Book of Life; and unto them will I grant an
      inheritance at my right hand. And now my brethren, what have ye to say against this? I say
      unto you, if ye speak against it, it matters not, for the word of God must be fulfilled. For
      what shepherd is there among you having many sheep, doth not watch over them, that the wolves
      enter not and devour his flock? And behold, if a wolf enter his flock, doth he not drive him
      out? Yea, and at the last, if he can he will destroy him. And now I say unto you, that the
      good shepherd doth call after you; and if you will hearken unto his voice, he will bring you
      into his fold, and ye are his sheep; and he commandeth you that ye suffer no ravenous wolf to
      enter among you, that ye may not be destroyed. And now I, Alma, do command you in the language
      of him who hath commanded me, that ye observe to do the words which I have spoken unto you. I
      speak by way of command unto you that belong to the church; and unto those which do not belong
      to the church, I speak by way of invitation, saying, Come and be baptized unto repentance,
      that ye also may be partakers of the fruit of the tree of life. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that after Alma had made an end of speaking unto the people of
      the church, which was established in the city of Zarahemla, he ordained priests and elder, by
      laying on his hands according to the order of God, to preside and watch over the church. And
      it came to pass that whomsoever did not belong to the church who repented of their sins, was
      baptized unto repentance, and was received into the church. And it also came to pass that
      whomsoever did belong to the church, that did not repent of their wickedness, and humble
      themselves before God; I mean those which were lifted up in the pride of their hearts; the
      same were rejected, and their names were blotted out, that their names were not numbered among
      those of the righteous; and thus began to establish the order of the church in the city of
      Zarahemla. Now I would that ye should understand that the word of God was liberal unto all;
      that no one was deprived of the privilege of assembling themselves together to hear the word
      of God; nevertheless the children of God were commanded that they should gather themselves
      together oft and join in fasting and mighty prayer, in behalf of the welfare of the souls of
      those who knew not God. And now it came to pass that when Alma had made those regulations, he
      departed from them, yea, from the church which was in the city of Zarahemla, and went over
      upon the east of the river Sidon, into the valley of Gideon, there having been a city built
      which was called the city of Gideon, which was in the valley that was called Gideon, being
      called after the man which was slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword. And Alma went and
      began to declare the word of God unto the church which was established in the valley of
      Gideon, according to the revelation of the truth of the word which had been spoken by his
      fathers, and according to the spirit of prophecy which was in him, according to the testimony
      of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, which should come for to redeem his people from their sins,
      and by the holy order by which he was called. And thus it is written. Amen. </text>

    <text> Behold my beloved brethren, seeing that I have been permitted to come unto you, therefore
      I attempt to address you in my language; yea, by my own mouth, seeing that it is the first
      time that I have spoken unto you by the words of my mouth, I having been wholly confined to
      the judgment seat, having had much business that I could not have come unto you; and even I
      could not have come now at this time, were it not that the judgment seat hath been given to
      another, to reign in my stead; and the Lord in much mercy hath granted that I should come unto
      you. And behold, I have come, having great hopes and much desire that I should find that ye
      had humbled yourselves before God, and that ye have continued in the supplicating of his
      grace, that I should find that ye were blameless before him; that I should find that ye were
      not in the awful dilemma that our brethren were in at Zarahemla; but blessed be the name of
      God that he hath given me to know, yea, hath given unto me the exceeding great joy of knowing
      that they are established again in the way of his righteousness. And I trust according to the
      spirit of God which is in me, that I shall also have joy over you; nevertheless I do not
      desire that my joy over you, should come by the cause of so much afflictions and sorrow which
      I have had for the brethren at Zarahemla: for behold, my joy cometh over them after wading
      through much afflictions and sorrow. But behold, I trust that ye are not in a state of so much
      unbelief as were your brethren; I trust that ye are not lifted up in the pride of your hearts;
      yea, I trust that ye have not set your hearts upon riches, and the vain things of the world;
      yea, I trust that you do not worship idols, but that ye do worship the true and the living
      God, and that ye look forward for the remission of your sins with an everlasting faith which
      is to come. For behold, I say unto you, there be many things to come; and behold, there is one
      thing which is of more importance than they all: for behold, the time is not far distant, that
      the Redeemer liveth and cometh among his people. Behold, I do not say that he will come among
      us at the time of his dwelling in his mortal tabernacle; for behold, the spirit hath not said
      unto me that this should be the case. Now as to this thing I do not know, but this much I do
      know, that the Lord God hath the power to do all things which is according to his word. But
      behold, the spirit hath said this much unto me, saying: Cry unto this people, saying, Repent
      ye, and prepare the way of the Lord, and walk in his paths, which are straight: for behold,
      the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, and the Son of God cometh upon the face of the earth. And
      behold, he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem, which is the land of our forefathers, she
      being a Virgin, a precious and chosen vessel, who shall be overshadowed, and conceive by the
      power of the Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son, yea, even the Son of God; and he shall go
      forth, suffering pains, and afflictions, and temptations of every kind; and this that the word
      might be fulfilled which saith, He will take upon him the pains and the sickness of his
      people; and he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which binds his
      people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy,
      according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to suffer his people
      according to their infirmities. Now the spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God
      suffereth according to the flesh, that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he
      might blot out their transgressions, according to the power of his deliverance; and now
      behold, this is the testimony which is in me. Now I say unto you, that ye must repent, and be
      born again: for the spirit saith, If ye are not born again, ye cannot inherit the Kingdom of
      Heaven; therefore come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye may be washed from your sins,
      that ye may have faith on the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world, which is
      mighty to save and to cleanse from all unrighteousness; yea, I say unto you, Come and fear
      not, and lay aside every sin, which easily doth beset you, which doth bind you down to
      destruction; yea, come and go forth, and shew unto your God that ye are willing to repent of
      your sins, and enter into a covenant with him to keep his commandments, and witness it unto
      him this day, by going into the waters of baptism; and whosoever doeth this, and keepeth the
      commandments of God from thenceforth, the same will remember that I say unto him, yea, he will
      remember that I have said unto him, he shall have eternal life, according to the testimony of
      the Holy Spirit, which testifieth in me. And now my beloved brethren, do you believe these
      things? Behold, I say unto you, yea, I know that you believe them; and the way that I know
      that ye believe them, is by the manifestation of the spirit which is in me. And now because
      your faith is strong concerning that, yea, concerning the things which I have spoken, great is
      my joy. For as I said unto you from the beginning, that I had much desire that ye was not in
      the state of dilemma like your brethren, even so I have found that my desires have been
      gratified. For I perceive that ye are in the paths of righteousness; I perceive that ye are in
      the path which leads to the kingdom of God; yea, I perceive that ye are making his paths
      straight; I perceive that it hath been made known unto you by the testimony of his word, that
      he cannot walk in crooked paths; neither doth he vary from that which he hath said; neither
      hath he a shadow of turning from the right to the left, or from that which is right to that
      which is wrong; therefore, his course is one eternal round. And he doth not dwell in unholy
      temples; neither can filthiness, or any thing which is unclean be received into the kingdom of
      God; therefore I say unto you, the time shall come, yea, and it shall be at the last day, that
      he which is filthy, shall remain in his filthiness. And now my beloved brethren, I have said
      these things unto you, that I might awaken you to a sense of your duty to God, that ye may
      walk blameless before him; that ye may walk after the holy order of God, after which ye have
      been received. And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive, and gentle; easy
      to be entreated; full of patience and long suffering; being temperate in all things; being
      diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for whatsoever things ye
      stand in need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever
      things ye do receive, and see that ye have faith, hope, and charity, and then ye will always
      abound in good works; and may the Lord bless you, and keep your garments spotless, that ye may
      at last be brought to sit down with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and the Holy Prophets, which
      have been ever since the world began, having your garments spotless, even as their garments
      are spotless in the kingdom of Heaven, to go no more out. And now my beloved brethren, I have
      spoken these words unto you, according to the spirit which testifieth in me; and my soul doth
      exceedingly rejoice, because of the exceeding diligence and heed which ye have given unto your
      word. And now, may the peace of God rest upon you, and upon your houses and land, and upon
      your flocks and herds, and all that you possess; your women and your children, according to
      your faith and good works, for this time forth and forever. And thus I have spoken. Amen.

    <text> And now it came to pass that Alma returned from the land of Gideon, after having taught
      the people of Gideon many things which cannot be written, having established the order of the
      church, according as he had before done in the land of Zarahemla; yea, he returned to his own
      house at Zarahemla, to rest himself from the labors which he had performed. And thus ended the
      ninth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi. And it came to pass in the
      commencement of the tenth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi, that Alma
      departed from thence, and took his journey over into the land of Melek, on the west of the
      river Sidon, on the west, by the borders of the wilderness; And he began to teach the people
      in the land of Melek, according to the holy order of God by which he had been called; and he
      began to teach the people throughout all the land of Melek. And it came to pass that the
      people came to him throughout all the borders of the land which was by the wilderness side.
      And it came to pass that they were baptized throughout all the land, so that when he had
      finished his work at Melek, he departed thence, and travelled three days' journey on the north
      of the land of Melek; and he came to a city which was called Ammonihah. Now it was the custom
      of the people of Nephi, to call their lands, and their cities, and their villages, yea, even
      all their small villages, after the name of him, who first possessed them; and thus it was
      with the land of Ammonihah. And it came to pass that when Alma came to the city of Ammonihah,
      he began to preach the word of God unto them. Now Satan had gotten great hold upon the hearts
      of the people of the city of Ammonihah; therefore they would not hearken unto the words of
      Alma. Nevertheless Alma labored much in the spirit, wrestling with God in mighty prayer, that
      he would pour out his spirit upon the people which was in the city; that he would also grant
      that he might baptize them unto repentance; nevertheless, they hardened their hearts, saying
      unto him, Behold, we know that thou art Alma; and we know that thou art High Priest over the
      church which thou hast established in many parts of the land, according to your tradition; and
      we are not of the church, and we do not believe in such foolish traditions. And now we know
      that because we are not of thy church, we know that thou hast no power over us; and thou hast
      delivered up the judgment seat unto Nephihah; therefore thou art not the Chief Judge over us.
      Now when the people had said this, and had withstood all his words, and reviled him, and spit
      upon him, and caused that he should be cast out of their city, he departed thence and took his
      journey towards the city which was called Aaron. And it came to pass that while he was
      journeying thither, being weighed down with sorrow, wading through much tribulation and
      anguish of souls, because of the wickedness of the people which was in the city of Ammonihah.
      And it came to pass that while Alma was weighed down with sorrow, behold, and angel of the
      Lord appeared unto him saying, Blessed art thou, Alma; therefore lift up thy head and rejoice,
      for thou hast great cause to rejoice; for thou hast been faithful in keeping the commandments
      of God from the time which thou received thy first message from him. Behold, I am he that
      delivered it into you; and behold, I am sent to command thee that thou return to the city of
      Ammonihah, and preach again unto the people of the city; yea, preach unto them. --Yea, say
      unto them, except they repent, the Lord God will destroy them. For behold, they do study at
      this time that they may destroy the liberty of thy people, (for thus saith the Lord,) which is
      contrary to the statutes, and judgments, and commandments which he hath given unto his people.
      Now it came to pass that after Alma had received his message from the angel of the Lord, he
      returned speedily to the land of Ammonihah. And it came to pass that he entered the city by
      another way, yea, by the way which was on the south of the city of Ammonihah. And it came to
      pass that as he entered the city, he was an hungered, and he saith to a man, Will ye give to
      an humble servant of God something to eat? And the man saith unto him, I am a Nephite, and I
      know that thou art a Holy Prophet of God, for thou art the man which an angel saith in a
      vision, Thou shalt receive; therefore go with me into my house, and I will impart unto thee of
      my food; and I know that thou will be a blessing unto me and my house. And it came to pass
      that the man received him into his house; and the man was called Amulek; and he brought forth
      bread and meat, and sat before Alma. And it came to pass that Alma ate bread and was filled;
      and he blessed Amulek and his house, and he gave thanks unto God. And after he had eat and was
      filled, he said unto Amulek, I am Alma, and am the High Priest over the church of God
      throughout the land. And behold, I have been called to preach the word of God among all this
      people, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy; and I was in this land, and they
      would not receive me, but they cast me out, and I was about to set my back towards this land
      forever. But behold, I have been commanded that I should turn again and prophesy unto this
      people, yea, and to testify against them concerning their iniquities. And now Amulek, because
      thou hast fed me and took me in, thou art blessed: for I was an hungered, for I had fasted
      many days. And it came to pass that Alma tarried many days with Amulek, before he began to
      preach unto the people. And it came to pass that the people did wax more gross in their
      iniquities. And the word came to Alma, saying, Go; and also say unto my servant Amulek, Go
      forth and prophesy unto this people, saying: Repent ye, for thus saith the Lord: Except ye
      repent, I will visit this people in mine anger; yea, and I will not turn my fierce anger away.
      And it came to pass that Alma went forth, and also Amulek, among the people, to declare the
      words of God unto them; and they were filled with the Holy Ghost; and they had power given
      unto them, insomuch that they could not be confined in dungeons; neither were it possible that
      any man could slay them; nevertheless they did not exercise their power until they were bound
      in bands and cast into prison. Now this was done that the Lord might show forth his power in
      them. And it came to pass that they went forth and began to preach and to prophesy unto the
      people, according to the spirit and power which the Lord had given them. </text>

    <text> And again: I Alma, having been commanded of God that I should take Amulek and go forth
      and preach again unto this people, or the people which was in the city of Ammonihah. --And it
      came to pass as I began to preach unto them, they began to contend with me, saying: Who art
      thou? Suppose ye that we shall believe the testimony of one man, although he should preach
      unto us that the earth should pass away? Now they understood not the words which they spake,
      for they knew not that the earth should pass away. And they sayeth also, We will not believe
      thy words, if thou shouldst prophesy that this great city should be destroyed in one day. Now
      they knew not that God could do such marvellous works, for they were a hard hearted and a
      stiffnecked people. And they sayeth, Who is God, that sendeth no more authority than one man
      among this people, to declare unto them the truth of such great and marvellous things? And
      they stood forth to lay their hands on me; behold, they did not. And I stood with boldness to
      declare unto them, yea, I did boldly testify unto them, saying: Behold, O ye wicked and
      perverse generation, how have ye forgotten the tradition of your fathers; yea, how soon ye
      have forgotten the commandments of God. Do ye not remember that our father Lehi was brought
      out of Jerusalem by the hand of God? Do ye not remember that they were all led by him through
      the wilderness? And have ye forgotten so soon how many times he delivered our fathers out of
      the hands of their enemies, and preserved them from being destroyed, even by the hands of
      their own brethren? Yea, and if it had not been for his matchless power, and his mercy, and
      his long suffering towards us, we should unavoidably have been cut off from the face of the
      earth, long before this period of time, and perhaps been consigned to a state of endless
      misery and wo. Behold, now I say unto you, that he commandeth you to repent; and except ye
      repent, ye can in no wise inherit the kingdom of God. But behold, this is not all: he hath
      commanded you to repent, or he will utterly destroy you from off the face of the earth; yea,
      he will visit you in his anger, and in his fierce anger he will not turn away. Behold, do ye
      not remember the words which he spake unto Lehi, saying, That inasmuch as ye shall keep my
      commandments, ye shall prosper in the land? And again it is said, That inasmuch as ye will not
      keep my commandments, ye shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. Now I would that ye
      should remember, that inasmuch as the Lamanites have not kept the commandments of God, they
      have been cut off from the presence of the Lord. Now we see that the word of the Lord hath
      been verified in this thing, and the Lamanites have been cut off from his presence, from the
      beginning of their transgressions in the land. Nevertheless I say unto you, that it shall be
      more tolerable for them in the day of judgment, than for you, if ye remain in your sins; yea,
      and even more tolerable for them in this life, than for you, except ye repent, for there are
      many promises which is extended to the Lamanites: for it is because of the traditions of their
      fathers that causeth them to remain in their state of ignorance; therefore the Lord will be
      merciful unto them, and prolong their existence in the land. And at some period of time they
      will be brought to believe in his word, and to know of the incorrectness of the traditions of
      their fathers; and many of them will be saved, for the Lord will be merciful unto all who call
      on his name. But behold, I say unto you, that if ye persist in your wickedness, that your days
      shall not be prolonged in the land, for the Lamanites shall be sent upon you; and if ye repent
      not, they shall come in a time when you know not, and ye shall be visited with utter
      destruction; and it shall be according to the fierce anger of the Lord; for he will not suffer
      you that ye shall live in you iniquities, to destroy his people. I say unto you, Nay; he would
      rather suffer that the Lamanites might destroy all this people which is called the people of
      Nephi, if it were possible that they could fall into sins and transgressions, after having so
      much light and so much knowledge given unto them of the Lord their God; yea, after having been
      such a highly favored people of the Lord; yea, after having been favored above every other
      nation, kindred, tongue, or people; after having had all things made known unto them,
      according to their desires, and their faith, and prayers, of that which has been, and which
      is, and which is to come; having been visited by the spirit of God; having conversed with
      angels, and having been spoken unto by the voice of the Lord; and having the spirit of
      prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and also many gifts: the gift of speaking with
      tongues, and the gift of preaching, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the gift of
      translation; yea, and after having been delivered of God out of the land of Jerusalem, by the
      hand of the Lord; having been saved from famine, and from sickness, and all manner of diseases
      of every kind; and they having been waxed strong in battle, that they might not be destroyed;
      having been brought out of bondage time after time, and having been kept and preserved until
      now; and they have been prospered until they are rich in all manner of things. And now behold
      I say unto you, that if this people, who have received so many blessings from the hand of the
      Lord, should transgress, contrary to the light and knowledge which they do have; I say unto
      you, that if this be the case; that if they should fall into transgression, that it would be
      far more tolerable for the Lamanites than for them. For behold, the promises of the Lord, are
      extended to the Lamanites, but they are not unto you, if ye transgress: for hath not the Lord
      expressly promised and firmly decreed, that if ye will rebel against him, that ye shall
      utterly be destroyed from off the face of the earth? And now for this cause, that ye may not
      be destroyed, the Lord hath sent his angel to visit many of his people, declaring unto them
      that they must go forth and cry mightily unto this people, saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom
      of Heaven is nigh at hand; and not many days hence, the Son of God shall come in his glory;
      and his glory shall be the glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace, equity and
      truth, full of patience, mercy, and long suffering, quick to hear the cries of his people, and
      to answer their prayers. And behold, he cometh to redeem those who will be baptized unto
      repentance, through faith on his name; therefore prepare ye the way of the Lord, for the time
      is at hand that every man shall reap a reward of their works, according to that which they
      have been: if they have been righteous, they shall reap the salvation of their souls,
      according to the power and deliverance of Jesus Christ; and if they have been evil, they shall
      reap the damnation of their souls, according to the power and captivation of the Devil. --Now
      behold, this is the voice of the angel, crying unto the people. And now my beloved brethren,
      for ye are my brethren, and ye had ought to be loved, and ye had ought to bring forth works
      which is mete for repentance, seeing that your hearts have been grossly hardened against the
      word of God, and seeing that ye are a lost and fallen people. Now it came to pass that when I,
      Alma, had spoken these words, behold, the people were wroth with me, because I said unto them
      that they were a hardhearted and a stiffnecked people; and also because I had said unto them
      that they were a lost and a fallen people, they were angry with me, and sought to lay their
      hands upon me, that they might cast me into prison; but it came to pass that the Lord did not
      suffer them that they should take me at a time and cast me into prison. And it came to pass
      that Amulek went and stood forth, and began to preach unto them also. And now the words of
      Amulek are not all written; nevertheless a part of his words are written in this book. </text>

    <text> Now these are the words that Amulek preached unto the people which was in the land of
      Ammonihah, saying: I am Amulek; I am the son of Giddonah, who was the son of Ishmael, who was
      a descendant of Aminadi: and it was that same Aminadi which interpreted the writing which was
      upon the wall of the temple, which was written by the finger of God. --And Aminadi was a
      descendant of Nephi, who was the son of Lehi, who came out of the land of Jerusalem, who was a
      descendant of Manasseh, who was the son of Joseph, which was sold into Egypt by the hands of
      his brethren. And behold, I am also a man of no small reputation among all those who know me;
      yea, and behold, I have many kindred and friends, and I have also acquired much riches by the
      hand of my industry; nevertheless, after all this, I never have known much of the ways of the
      Lord, and his mysteries and marvellous power. I said I never had known much of these things;
      but behold, I mistake, for I have seen much of his mysteries and his marvellous power; yea,
      even in the preservation of the lives of this people; nevertheless, I did harden my heart, for
      I was called many times, and I would not hear; therefore I knew concerning these things, yet I
      would not know; therefore I went on unbelieving against God, in the wickedness of my heart,
      even until the fourth day of this seventh month, which is in the tenth year of the reign of
      our Judges. As I was a journeying to see a very near kindred, behold an angel of the Lord
      appeared unto me, and said, Amulek, return to thine own house, for thou shalt feed a prophet
      of the Lord; yea, a holy man , which art a chosen man of God; for he hath fasteth many days
      because of the sins of this people, and he is an hungered, and thou shalt receive him into thy
      house and feed him, and he shall bless thee and thy house; and the blessing of the Lord shall
      rest upon thee and thy house. And it came to pass that I obeyed the voice of the angel, and
      returned towards my house. And as I was a going thither, I found the man which the angel said
      unto me, Thou shalt receive into thy house; and behold it was this same man which hath been
      speaking unto you concerning the things of God. --And the angel said unto me, He is a holy
      man; wherefore I know he is a holy man, because it was said by an angel of God. And again: I
      know that the things whereof he hath testified are true; for behold, I say unto you, that as
      the Lord liveth, even so he hath sent his angel to make these things manifest unto me; and
      this he hath done while this Alma hath dwelt at my house; for behold, he hath blessed mine
      home, he hath blessed me, and my woman, and my children, and my father, and my kinsfolks; yea,
      even all my kindred hath he blessed, and the blessings of the Lord hath rested upon us
      according to the words which he spake. And now when Amulek had spoken these words, the people
      began to be astonished, seeing there was more than one witness which testifieth of the things
      whereof they were accused, and also of the things which was to come, according to the spirit
      of prophecy which was in them; nevertheless, there were some among them which thought to
      question them, that by their cunning devices they might catch them in their words, that they
      might find witness against them, that they might deliver them to the Judges, that they might
      be judged according to the law, and that they might be slain or cast into prison, according to
      the crime which they could make appear, or witness against them. Now it was those men which
      sought to destroy them, which were Lawyers, which were hired or appointed by the people to
      administer the law at their times of trials, or at trials of the crimes of the people, before
      the Judges. Now these Lawyers were learned in all the arts and cunning of the people; and this
      was to enable them that they might be skilful in their profession. And it came to pass that
      they began to question Amulek, that thereby they might make him cross his words, or contradict
      the words which he should speak. Now they knew not that Amulek could know of their designs.
      But it came to pass as they began to question him, he perceived their thoughts, and he saith
      unto them, O ye wicked and perverse generation; ye Lawyers and hypocrites; for ye are laying
      the foundation of the Devil; for ye are laying traps and snares to catch the holy ones of God;
      ye are laying plans to pervert the ways of the righteous, and to bring down the wrath of God
      upon your heads, even to the utter destruction of this people; yea, well did Mosiah say, who
      was our last king, when he was about to deliver up the kingdom, having no one to confer it
      upon, causing that this people should be governed by their own voices; yea, well did he say,
      that if the time should come that the voice of this people should choose iniquity; that is, if
      the time should come that this people should fall into transgression, they would be ripe for
      destruction. And now I say unto you, that well doth the Lord judge your iniquities; well doth
      he cry unto this people, by the voice of his angels, Repent ye, repent, for the Kingdom of
      Heaven is at hand. Yea, well doth he cry, by the voice of his angels, that I will come down
      among my people with equity and justice in my hands. Yea, and I say unto you, that if it were
      not for the prayers of the righteous, which are now in the land, that ye would even now be
      visited with utter destruction; yet it would not be by flood, as were the people in the days
      of Noah, but it would be by famine, and by pestilence, and the sword. Now it is by the prayers
      of the righteous that ye are spared; now therefore if ye will cast out the righteous from
      among you, then will not the Lord stay his hand, but in his fierce anger he will come down
      against you; then ye shall be smitten by famine, and by pestilence, and by the sword; and the
      time is soon at hand, except ye repent. And now it came to pass that the people were more
      angry with Amulek, and they cried out saying: This man doth revile against our laws, which are
      just, and our wise Lawyers, which we have selected. But Amulek stretched forth his hand, and
      cried the mightier unto them, saying: O ye wicked and perverse generation; why hath Satan got
      such great hold upon your hearts? Why will ye yield yourselves unto him, that he may have
      power over you, to blind your eyes, that ye will not understand the words which are spoken,
      according to their truth? For behold, have I testified against your law? Ye do not understand;
      ye say that I have spoken against your law; but have I not; but I have spoken in favor of your
      law, to your condemnation. And now behold, I say unto you, that the foundation of the
      destruction of this people is a beginning to be laid by the unrighteousness of your lawyers
      and your Judges. And now it came to pass that when Amulek had spoken these words, the people
      cried out against him, saying, Now we know that this man is a child of the Devil, for he hath
      lied unto us; for he hath spoken against our law. And now he saith that he hath not spoken
      against it. And again: he hath reviled against our Lawyers, and our Judges, &amp;c. And it
      came to pass that the Lawyers put it into their hearts that they should remember these things
      against him. And it came to pass that there was one among them whose name was Zeezrom. Now he
      being the foremost to accuse Amulek and Alma, he being one of the most expert among them,
      having much business to do among the people. Now the object of these Lawyers were to get gain;
      and they got gain according to their employ. </text>

    <text> Now it was in the law of Mosiah that every man which was a Judge of the law, or which was
      appointed to be Judges, should receive wages according to the time which they labored to judge
      those which were brought before them to be judged. Now if a man oweth another, and he would
      not pay that which he owe, he was complained of to the Judge; and the Judge executed
      authority, and sent forth officers that the man should be brought before him; and he judgeth
      the man according to the law and the evidence which are brought against him; and thus the man
      was compelled to pay that which he oweth, or be striped, or be cast out from among the people,
      as a thief and a robber. And the Judge receiveth for his wages according to his time: a senine
      of gold for a day, or a senum of silver, which is equal to a senine of gold; and this is
      according to the law which was given. Now these are the names of the different pieces of their
      gold, and of their silver, according to their value. And the names are given by the Nephites;
      for they did not reckon after the manner of the Jews which were at Jerusalem; neither did they
      measure after the manner of the Jews, but they altered their reckoning and their measure,
      according to the minds of the circumstances of the people, in every generation, until the
      reign of the Judges; they having been established by king Mosiah. Now the reckoning is thus: A
      senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold. A senum of silver, an
      amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver. A senum of silver was equal to a
      senine of gold; and either for a measure of barley, and also for a measure of every kind of
      grain. Now the amount of a seon of gold, was twice the value of a senine; and a shum of gold
      was twice the value of a seon; and a limnah of gold was the value of them all; and an amner of
      silver was as great as two senums; and an ezrom of silver was as great as four senums; and an
      onti was as great as them all. Now this is the value of the lesser numbers of their reckoning:
      A shiblon is half of a senum: therefore a shiblon for half a measure of barley; and a shiblum
      is a half of shiblon; and a leah is the half of a shiblum. Now this is their number, according
      to their reckoning. Now an antion of gold is equal to three shublons. Now it was for the sole
      purpose for to get gain, because they received wages according to their employ; therefore they
      did stir up the people to riotings, and all manner of disturbances and wickedness , that they
      might have more employ; that they might get money according to the suits which was brought
      before them; therefore they did stir up the people against Alma and Amulek. And this Zeezrom
      began to question Amulek, saying: Will ye answer me a few questions which I shall ask you? Now
      Zeezrom was a man which was expert in the devises of the Devil, that he might destroy that
      which was good; therefore he saith unto Amulek, Will ye aaswer the questions which I shall put
      unto you? And Amulek saith unto him, Yea, if it be according to the spirit of the Lord, which
      is in me; for I shall say nothing contrary to the spirit of the Lord. And Zeezrom saith unto
      him, Behold, here is six onties of silver, and all these will I give to thee if thou wilt deny
      the existence of a Supreme Being. Now Amulek saith, O thou child of Hell, why tempt ye me?
      Knowest thou that the righteous yieldeth to no such temptations? Believest thou that there is
      no God? I say unto you, nay: thou knowest that there is a God, but thou lovest that lucre more
      than him. And now thou hast lied unto God before me. Thou saidst unto me, Behold these six
      onties, which are of great worth, I will give unto thee, when thou had it in thy heart to
      retain them from me; and it was only thy desire that I should deny the true and living God,
      that thou mightest have cause to destroy me. And now behold, for this great evil thou shalt
      have thy reward. And Zeezrom saith unto him, Thou sayest there is a true and living God? And
      Amulek saith, Yea, there is a true and living God. Now Zeezrom saith, Is there more than one
      God? And he answered No. Now Zeezrom saith unto him again: How knowest thou these things? And
      he saith An angel hath made them known unto me. And Zeezrom saith again: Who is he that shall
      come? Is it the Son of God? And he said unto him, Yea. And Zeezrom saith again: Shall he save
      his people in their sins? And Amulek answered and said unto him, I say unto you he shall not,
      for it is impossible for him to deny his word. Now Zeezrom saith unto the people, See that ye
      remember these things; for he saith there is but one God; yet he saith that the Son of God
      shall come, but he shall not save his people, as though he had authority to command God. Now
      Amulek saith again unto him, Behold thou hast lied, for thou sayest that I spake as though I
      had authority to command God, because I said he shall not save his people in their sins. And I
      say unto you again, that he cannot save them in their sins; for I cannot deny his word, and he
      hath said that no unclean thing can inherit the Kingdom of Heaven? --Therefore ye cannot be
      saved in your sins. Now Zeezrom saith again unto him: Is the Son of God the very Eternal
      Father? And Amulek saith unto him, Yea, he is the very Eternal Father of Heaven and of Earth,
      and all things which in them is; he is the beginning and the end, the first and the last; and
      he shall come into the world to redeem his people; and he shall take upon him the
      transgressions of those who believe on his name; and these are they that shall have eternal
      life, and salvation cometh to none else; therefore the wicked remain as though there had been
      no redemption made, except it be the loosing of the bands of death; for behold, the day cometh
      that all shall rise from the dead and stand before God, and be judged according to their
      works. Now there is a death which is called a temporal death; and the death of Christ shall
      loose the bands of this temporal death, that all shall be raised from this temporal death; the
      spirit and the body shall be re- united again, in its perfect form; both limb and joint shall
      be restored to its proper frame, even as we now are at this time; and we shall be brought to
      stand before God, knowing even as we know now, and have a bright recollection of all our
      guilt. Now this restoration shall come to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both
      male and female, both the wicked, and the righteous; and even there shall not so much as a
      hair of their heads be lost; but all things shall be restored to its perfect frame, as it is
      now, or in the body, and shall be brought and be arraigned before the bar of Christ the Son of
      God, the Father, and the Holy Spirit, which is the Son, and God the Father, and the Holy
      Spirit, which is one Eternal God, to be judged according to their works, whether they be good
      or whether they be evil. Now behold I have spoken unto you, concerning the death of the mortal
      body, and also concerning the resurrection of the mortal body. I say unto you, that this
      mortal body is raised to an immortal body; that is from death; even from the first death, unto
      life, that they can die no more; their spirits uniting with their bodies, never to be divided;
      thus the whole becoming spiritual and immortal, that they can no more see corruption. Now when
      Amulek had finished these words, the people began to be astonished, and also Zeezrom began to
      tremble. And thus ended the words of Amulek, or this is all that I have written. </text>

    <text> Now Alma, seeing that the words of Amulek had silenced Zeezrom, for he beheld that Amulek
      had caught him in his lying and deceiving, to destroy him, and seeing that he began to tremble
      under the consciousness of his guilt, he opened his mouth and began to speak unto him, and to
      establish the words of Amulek, and to explain things beyond, or to unfold the Scriptures
      beyond that which Amulek had done. Now the words that Alma spake unto Zeezrom, was heard by
      the people round about: for the multitude was great, and he spake on this wise: Now Zeezrom,
      seeing that thou hast been taken in thy lying and craftiness, for thou hast not lied unto men
      only, but thou hast lied unto God. For behold, he knows all thy thoughts; and thou seest that
      thy thoughts are made known unto us by his spirit; and thou seest that we know that thy plan
      was a very subtle plan, as to the subtlety of the Devil, for to lie and to deceive this
      people, that thou mightest set them against us, to revile us and to cast us out. Now this was
      a plan of thine adversary, and he hath exercised his power in thee. Now I would that ye should
      remember that what I say unto thee, I say unto all. And behold, I say unto you all, that this
      was a snare of the adversary, which he hath laid to catch this people, that he might bring you
      into subjection unto him, that he might encircle you about with his chains, that he might
      chain you down to everlasting destruction, according to the power of his captivity. Now when
      Alma had spoken these words, Zeezrom began to tremble more exceedingly, for he was convinced
      more and more of the power of God; and he was also convinced that Alma and Amulek had a
      knowledge of him, for he was convinced that they knew the thoughts and intents of his heart:
      for power was given unto them that they might know of these things, according to the spirit of
      prophecy. And Zeezrom began to inquire of them diligently, that he might know more concerning
      the kingdom of God. And he saith unto Alma, What does this mean which Amulek hath spoken
      concerning the resurrection of the dead, that all shall rise from the dead, both the just and
      the unjust, and are brought to stand before God, to be judged according to their works? And
      now Alma began to expound these things unto him, saying, It is given unto many to know the
      mysteries of God; nevertheless they are laid under a strict command, that they shall not
      impart only according to the portion of his word, which he doth grant unto the children of
      men, according to the heed and diligence which they give unto him; and therefore he that will
      harden his heart, the same receiveth the lesser portion of the word; and he that will not
      harden his heart, to him is given the greater portion of the word, until it is given unto him
      to know the mysteries of God, until they know them in full; and he that will harden his heart,
      to him is given the lesser portion of the word, until they know nothing concerning his
      mysteries; and then they are taken captive by the Devil, and led by his will down to
      destruction. Now this is what is meant by the chains of Hell; and Amulek hath spoken plainly
      concerning death, and being raised from this mortality to a state of immortality, and being
      brought before the bar of God, to be judged according to our works. Then if our hearts have
      been hardened, yea, if we have hardened our hearts against the word, insomuch that it hath not
      been found in us, then will our state be awful, for then we shall be condemned: for our words
      will condemn us, yea, all our work will condemn us; we shall not be found spotless; and our
      thoughts will also condemn us; and in this awful state, we shall not durst look up to our God;
      and we would fain be glad if we could command the rocks and the mountains to fall upon us, to
      hide us from his presence. But this cannot be; we must come forth and stand before him in his
      glory, and in his power, and in his might, majesty, and dominion, and acknowledge to the
      everlasting shame, that all his judgments are just; that he is just in all his works, and that
      he is merciful unto the children of men, and that he hath all power to save every man that
      believeth on his name, and bringeth forth mete for repentance. And now behold I say unto you,
      then cometh a death, even a second death, which is a spiritual death; then is a time whosoever
      dieth in his sins, as to the temporal death, shall also die a spiritual death; yea, he shall
      die as to things pertaining unto righteousness; then is the time when their torments shall be
      as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flames ascendeth up forever and ever; and then is the
      time that they shall be chained down to an everlasting destruction, according to the power and
      captivity of Satan; he having subjected them according to his will. Then I say unto you, they
      shall be as though there had been no redemption made; for they cannot be redeemed according to
      God's justice; and they cannot die, seeing there is no more corruption. Now it came to pass
      that when Alma had made an end of speaking these words, the people began to be more
      astonished; but there was one Antionah, who was a chief ruler among them, come forth and said
      unto him, What is this that thou hast said, that man should rise from the dead and be changed
      from this mortal to an immortal state, that the soul can never die? What does this Scripture
      mean, which saith that God placed Cherubims and a flaming sword on the east of the garden of
      Eden, lest our first parents should enter and partake of the fruit of the tree of life, and
      live forever? And thus we see that there was no possible chance that they should live forever.
      Now Alma saith unto him, This is the thing which I was about to explain. Now we see that Adam
      did fall by partaking of the forbidden fruit, according to the word of God; and thus we see
      that by his fall, that all mankind became a lost and a fallen people. And now behold, I say
      unto you, that if it had been possible for Adam for to have partaken of the fruit of the tree
      of life at that time, that there would have been no death, and the word would have been void,
      making God a liar: for he said, If thou eat, thou shalt surely die. --And we see that death
      comes upon mankind, yea, the death which has been spoken of by Amulek, which is the temporal
      death; nevertheless there was a space granted unto man, in which he might repent; therefore
      this life became a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for
      that endless state, which has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection of the
      dead. Now if it had not been for the plan of redemption, which was laid from the foundation of
      the world, there could have been no resurrection of the dead; but there was a plan of
      redemption laid, which shall bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, of which has been
      spoken. And now behold, if it were possible that our first parents could have went forth and
      partaken of the tree of life, they would have been forever miserable, having no preparatory
      state; and thus the plan of redemption would have been frustrated, and the word of God would
      have been void, taking none effect. But behold, it was not so; but it was appointed unto man
      that they must die; and after death, they must come to judgment; even that same judgment of
      which we have spoken, which is the end. And after God had appointed that these things should
      come unto man, behold, then he saw that it was expedient that man should know concerning the
      things whereof he had appointed unto them; therefore he sent angels to converse with them,
      which caused men to behold of his glory. And they began from the time forth to call on his
      name; therefore God conversed with men, and made known unto them the plan of redemption, which
      had been prepared from the foundation of the world; and this he made known unto them,
      according to their faith and repentance, and their holy works; wherefore he gave commandments
      unto men, they having first transgressed the first commandments as to things which were
      temporal, and becoming as Gods, knowing good from evil, placing themselves in a state to act,
      or being placed in a state to act, according to their wills and pleasures, whether to do evil
      or to do good; therefore God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto them
      the plan of redemption, that they should not do evil, the penalty thereof being a second
      death, which was an everlasting death as to things pertaining unto righteousness; for on such
      the plan of redemption could have no power, for the works of justice could not be destroyed,
      according to the Supreme goodness of God. But God did call on men, in the name of his Son,
      (this being the plan of redemption which was laid,) saying: if ye will repent, and harden not
      your hearts, then I will have mercy upon you, through mine only begotten Son; therefore,
      whosoever repenteth, and hardeneth not his heart, he shall have claim on mercy through mine
      only begotten Son, unto a remission of their sins; and these shall enter into my rest. And
      whosoever will harden his heart, and will do iniquity, behold, I swear in my wrath that they
      shall not enter into my rest. And now my brethren, behold I say unto you, That if ye will
      harden your hearts, ye shall not enter into the rest of the Lord; therefore your iniquity
      provoketh him, that he sendeth down his wrath upon you as in the first provocation, yea,
      according to this word in the last provocation, as well as in the first, to the everlasting
      destruction of your souls; therefore, according to his word, unto the last death, as well as
      the first. And now my brethren, seeing we know these things, and they are true, let us repent,
      and harden not our hearts, that we provoke not the Lord our God to pull down his wrath upon us
      in these his second commandments which he hath given unto us; but let us enter into the rest
      of God, which is prepared according to his word. </text>

    <text> And again: My brethren, I would cite your minds forward to the time which the Lord God
      gave these commandments unto his children; and I would that ye should remember that the Lord
      God ordained Priests, after his holy order, which was after the order of his Son, to teach
      these things unto the people; and those Priests were ordained after the order of his Son, in a
      manner that thereby the people might know in what manner to look forward to his Son for
      redemption. And this is the manner after which they were ordained, being called and prepared
      from the foundation of the world, according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of their
      exceeding faith and good works; in the first place being left to choose good or evil;
      therefore they being chosen good, and exercising exceeding great faith, are called with a holy
      calling, yea, with that holy calling which was prepared with and according to, a preparatory
      redemption for such; and thus they having been called to this holy calling on account of their
      faith, while others would reject the spirit of God on account of the hardness of their hearts
      and blindness of their minds, while, if it had not been for this, they might had as great
      privilege as their brethren. Or in fine: In the first place they were on the same standing
      with their brethren; thus this holy calling being prepared from the foundation of the world
      for such as would not harden their hearts, being in and through the atonement of the only
      begotten Son, which was prepared; and thus being called by this holy calling, and ordained
      unto the High Priesthood of the holy order of God, to teach us his commandments unto the
      children of men, that they also might enter into his rest, this High Priesthood being after
      the order of his Son, which order was from the foundation of the world; or in other words,
      being without beginning of days or end of years, being prepared from eternity to all eternity,
      according to his foreknowledge of all things. Now they were ordained after this manner: Being
      called with a holy calling, and ordained with a holy ordinance, and taking upon them the High
      Priesthood of the holy order, which calling, and ordinance, and High Priesthood, is without
      beginning or end; thus they become High Priests forever, after the order of the Son of the
      only begotten of the Father, which is without beginning of days or end of years, which is full
      of grace, equity and truth. And thus it is. Amen. Now as I said concerning the holy order of
      this High Priesthood: There were many which were ordained and became High Priests of God; and
      it was on account of the exceeding faith and repentance, and their righteousness before God,
      they choosing to repent and work righteousness, rather than to perish; therefore they were
      called after this holy order, and were sanctified, and their garments were washed white,
      through the blood of the Lamb. Now they, after being sanctified by the Holy Ghost, having
      their garments made white, being pure and spotless before God, could not look upon sin, saving
      it were with abhorrence; and there were many, exceeding great many, which were made pure, and
      entered into the rest of the Lord their God. And now, my brethren, I would that ye should
      humble yourselves before God, and bring forth fruit mete for repentance, that ye may also
      enter into that rest; yea, humble yourselves even as the people in the days of Melchizedek,
      who was also a High Priest after this same order which I have spoken, who also took upon him
      the High Priesthood forever. And it was this same Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid tithes;
      yea, even our father Abraham paid tithes of one tenth part of all he possessed. Now these
      ordinances were given after this manner, that thereby the people might look forward on the Son
      of God, it being a type of his order, or it being his order; and this, that they might look
      forward to him for a remission of their sins, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord.
      Now this Melchizedek was a king over the land of Salem; and his people had waxed strong in
      iniquity and abominations; yea, they had all gone astray: they were full of all manner of
      wickedness; but Melchizedek having exercised mighty faith, and received the office of the High
      Priesthood, according to the holy order of God, did preach repentance unto his people. --And
      behold, they did repent; and Melchizedek did establish peace in the land in his days;
      therefore he was called the Prince of Peace, for he was the king of Salem; and he did reign
      under his father. Now there were many before him, and also there were many afterwards, but
      none were greater; therefore of him they have more particularly made mention. Now I need not
      rehearse the matter; what I have said, may suffice. Behold, the Scriptures are before you; if
      ye will arrest them, it shall be to your own destruction. And now it came to pass that when
      Alma had said these words unto them, he stretched forth his hand unto them and cried with a
      mighty voice, saying, Now is the time to repent, for the day of salvation draweth nigh; yea,
      and the voice of the Lord, by the mouth of angels, doth declare it unto all nations; yea, doth
      declare it, that they may have glad tidings of great joy; yea, and he doth sound these glad
      tidings among all his people, yea, even to them that are scattered abroad upon the face of the
      earth; wherefore they have come unto us. --And they are made known unto us in plain terms,
      that we may understand, that we cannot err; and this because of our being wanderers in a
      strange land; therefore we are thus highly favored, for we have these glad tidings declared
      unto us in all parts of our vineyard. For behold, angels are declaring it unto many at this
      time in our land; and this is for the purpose of preparing the hearts of the children of men
      for to receive his word, at the time of his coming in his glory. And now we only wait to hear
      the joyful news declared unto us by the mouth of angels, of his coming: for the time cometh,
      we know not how soon. Would to God that it might be in my day; but let it be sooner or later,
      in it I will rejoice. And it shall be knowon unto just and holy men, by the mouth of angels,
      at the time of his coming, that the words of our fathers might be fulfilled, according to that
      which they have spoken concerning him, which was according to the spirit of prophecy which was
      in them. And now my brethren, I wish from the inmost part of my heart, yea, with great
      anxiety, even unto pain, that ye would hearken unto my words, and cast off your sins, and not
      procrastinate the day of your repentance; that ye would humble yourselves before the Lord, and
      call on his holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above that
      which ye can bear, and thus be led by the holy spirit, becoming humble, meek, submissive,
      patient, full of love and all long suffering; having faith on the Lord; having a hope that ye
      shall receive eternal life; having the love of God always in your hearts, that ye may be
      lifted up at the last day, and enter into his rest; and may the Lord grant unto you
      repentance, that ye may not bring down his wrath upon you, that ye may not be bound down by
      the chains of hell, that ye may not suffer the second death. And it came to pass that Alma
      spake many more words unto the people, which are not written in this book. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that after he had made an end of speaking unto the people, many of
      them did believe on his words, and began to repent, and to search the Scriptures; but the more
      part of them were desirous that they might destroy Alma and Amulek: for they were angry with
      Alma, because of the plainness of his words unto Zeezrom; and they also said that Amulek had
      lied unto them, and had reviled against their law, and also against their Lawyers and Judges.
      And they were also angry with Alma and Amulek; and because they had testified so plainly
      against their wickedness, they sought to put them away privily. But it came to pass that they
      did not; but they took them and bound them with strong cords, and took them before the Chief
      Judge of the land. And the people went forth and witnessed against them, testifying that they
      had reviled against the law, and their Lawyers and Judges of the land, and also all the people
      that were in the land; and also testified that there was but one God, and that he should send
      his Son among the people, but he should not save them; and many such things did the people
      testify against Alma and Amulek. And it came to pass that it was done before the Chief Judge
      of the land. And it also came to pass that Zeezrom was astonished at the words which had been
      spoken; and he also knew concerning the blindness of the minds which he had caused among the
      people, by his lying words; and his soul began to be harrowed up, under a consciousness of his
      own guilt; yea, he began to be encircled about by the pains of hell. And it came to pass that
      he began to cry unto the people, saying: Behold, I am guilty, and these men are spotless
      before God. And it came to pass that he began to plead for them, from that time forth; but
      they reviled him, saying: Art thou also possessed with the Devil? And it came to pass that
      they spit upon him, and cast him out from among them, and also all those that believed in the
      words which had been spoken by Alma and Amulek; and they cast them out, and sent men to cast
      stones at them. And they brought their wives and children together, and whosoever believed or
      had been taught to believe in the word of God, they caused that they should be cast into the
      fire; and they also brought forth their records which contained the Holy Scriptures, and cast
      them into the fire also, that they might be burned and destroyed by fire. And it came to pass
      that they took Alma and Amulek, and carried them forth to the place of martyrdom, that they
      might witness the destruction of those which were consumed by fire. And it came to pass that
      when Amulek saw the pains of the women and children which were consuming in the fire, he was
      also pained; and he saith unto Alma, How can we witness this awful scene? Therefore let us
      stretch forth our hands, and exercise the power of God which is in us, and save them from the
      flames. But Alma saith unto him, The spirit constraineth me that I must not stretch forth mine
      hand; for behold, the Lord receiveth them up unto himself, in glory; and he doth not suffer
      that they may do this thing, or that the people may do this thing unto them, according to the
      hardness if their hearts, that the judgments which he shall exercise upon them in his wrath,
      may be just; and the blood of the innocent shall stand as a witness against them, yea, and cry
      mightily against them at the last day. Now Amulek saith unto Alma, Behold, perhaps they will
      burn us also. And Alma saith, Be it according to the will of the Lord. But behold, our work is
      not finished; therefore they burn us not. Now it came to pass that when the bodies of those
      which had been cast into the fire, were consumed, and also the records which were cast in with
      them, the Chief Judge of the land came and stood before Alma and Amulek, as they were bound;
      and he smote them with his hand upon their cheeks, and saith unto them, After what ye have
      seen, will ye preach again unto this people, that they shall be cast into a lake of fire and
      brimstone? Behold, ye see that ye had not power to save these which had been cast into the
      fire; neither hath God saved them because they were of thy faith. And the Judge smote them
      again upon their cheeks, and asked, What say ye for yourselves? Now this Judge was after the
      order and faith of Nehor, which slew Gideon. And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek answered
      him nothing; and he smote them again, and delivered them to the officers to be cast into
      prison. And it came to pass that when they had been cast into prison three days, there came
      many Lawyers, and Judges, and Priests, and teachers, which were of the profession of Nehor;
      and they came in unto the prison to see them, and they questioned them about many words; but
      they answered them nothing. And it came to pass that the Judge stood before them, and saith,
      Why do ye not answer the words of this people? Know ye not that I have the power to deliver ye
      up unto the flames? And he commanded them to speak; but they answered nothing. And it came to
      pass that they departed and went their ways, but came again on the morrow; and the Judge also
      smote them again on their cheeks. And many came forth also, and smote them, saying: Will ye
      stand again and Judge this people, and condemn our law? If ye have such great power, why do ye
      not deliver yourselves? And many such things did they say unto them, gnashing their teeth upon
      them, and spitting upon them, and saying, How shall ye look when we are damned? And many such
      things, yea, all manner of such things did they say unto them; and thus they did mock them,
      for many days. And they did withhold food from them. that they might hunger, and water, that
      they might thirst; and they also did take from them their clothes, that they were naked; and
      thus they were bound with strong cords, and confined in prison. And it came to pass after they
      had thus suffered for many days, (and it was on the twelfth day, in the tenth month, in the
      tenth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi,) that the Chief Judge over the
      land of Ammonihah, and many of their teachers and their Lawyers, went in unto the prison where
      Alma and Amulek was bound with cords. And the Chief Judge stood before them, and smote them
      again, and saith unto them, If ye have the power of God, deliver yourselves from these bands,
      and then we will believe that the Lord will destroy this people according to your words. And
      it came to pass that they all went forth and smote them, saying the same words, even until the
      last; and when the last had spoken unto them, the power of God was upon Alma and Amulek, and
      they arose and stood upon their feet; and Alma cried, saying, How long shall we suffer these
      great afflictions, O Lord? O Lord, give us strength according to our faith which is in Christ,
      even unto deliverance; and they break the cords with which they were bound; and when the
      people saw this, they began to flee, for the fear of destruction had come upon them. And it
      came to pass that so great was their fear, that they fell to the earth, and did not obtain the
      outer door of the prison; and the earth shook mightily, and the walls of the prison were wrent
      in twain, so that they fell to the earth; and the Chief Judge, and the Lawyers, and Priests,
      and teachers which smote upon Alma and Amulek, were slain by the fall thereof. And Alma and
      Amulek came forth out of the prison, and they were not hurt; for the Lord had granted unto
      them power, according to their faith which was in Christ. And they straightway came forth out
      of the prison; and they were loosed from their bands; and the prison had fallen to the earth,
      and every soul which was within the walls thereof, save it were Alma and Amulek, were slain;
      and they straightway came forth into the city. Now the people having heard a great noise, came
      running together by multitudes, to know the cause of it; and when they saw Alma and Amulek
      coming forth out of the prison, and the walls thereof had fallen to the earth, they were
      struck with great fear, and fled from the presence of Alma and Amulek, even as a goat fleeth
      with her young from two lions; and thus they did flee from the presence of Alma and Amulek.

    <text> And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek were commanded to depart out of the city; and
      they departed, and came out even into the land of Sidom; and behold, there they found all the
      people which had departed out of the land of Ammonihah, who had been cast out and stoned,
      because they believed in the words of Alma. And they related unto them all that had happened
      unto their wives and children, and also concerning themselves, and of their power of
      deliverance. And also Zeezrom lay sick at Sidom, with a burning fever, which was caused by the
      great tribulations of his mind, on account of his wickedness, for he supposed that Alma and
      Amulek was no more; and he supposed that they had been slain, by the cause of his iniquity.
      And this great sin, and his many other sins, did harrow up his mind until it did become
      exceeding sore, having no deliverance; therefore he began to be scorched with a burning heat.
      Now when he heard that Alma and Amulek was in the land of Sidom, his heart began to take
      courage; and he sent a message immediately unto them, desiring them to come unto him. And it
      came to pass that they went immediately, obeying the message which he had sent unto them; and
      they went in unto the house unto Zeezrom; and they found him upon his bed sick, being very low
      with a burning fever; and his mind also was exceeding sore, because of his iniquities; and
      when he saw them, he stretched forth his hand, and besought them that they would heal him. And
      it came to pass that Alma said unto him, taking him by the hand, Believest thou in the power
      of Christ unto salvation? And he answered and said, Yea, I belive all the words that thou hast
      taught. And Alma saith, If thou believest in the redemption of Christ, thou canst be healed.
      And he saith, Yea, I believe according to thy words. And then Alma cried unto the Lord,
      saying, O Lord our God, have mercy on this man, and heal him according to his faith which is
      in Christ. And it came to pass that when Alma said these words, that Zeezrom leaped upon his
      feet, and began to walk; and this was done to the great astonishment of all the people; and
      the knowledge of this went forth throughout all the land of Sidom. And Alma baptized Zeezrom
      unto the Lord; and he began from that time forth to preach unto the people. And Alma
      established a Church in the land of Sodom, and consecrated Priests and teachers in the land to
      baptize unto the Lord whosoever were desirous to be baptized. And it came to pass that they
      were many; for they did flock in from all the region round about Sidom, and were baptized; but
      as to the people that were in the land of Ammonihah, they yet remained a hardhearted and a
      stiffnecked people; and they repented not of their sins, ascribing all the power of Alma and
      Amulek to the Devil: for they were of the profession of Nehor, and did not believe in the
      repentance of their sins. And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek, Amulek having forsaken all
      his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, which was in the land of Ammonihah, for the
      word of God, he being rejected by those which were once his friends, and also by his father
      and his kindred; therefore, after Alma having established the Church at Sidom, seeing a great
      check, yea, seeing that the people were checked as to the pride of their hearts, and began to
      humble themselves before God, and began to assemble together at their sanctuaries to worship
      God before the alter, watching and praying continually, that they might be delivered from
      Satan, and from death, and from destruction: Now as I said, Alma having seen all these things,
      therefore he took Amulek and came over to the land of Zarahemla, and took him to his own
      house, and did administer unto him in his tribulations, and strengthened him in the Lord. And
      thus ended the tenth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the Judges over the people of
      Nephi, on the fifth day of the second month, there having been much peace in the land of
      Zarahemla; there having been no wars nor contentions for a certain number of years; even until
      the fifth day of the second month, in the eleventh year, there was a cry of war heard
      throughout the land; for behold, the armies of the Lamanites had come in on the wilderness
      side, into the borders of the land, even into the city of Ammonihah, and began to slay the
      people, and to destroy the city. And now it came to pass before the Nephites could raise a
      sufficient army to drive them out of the land, they had destroyed the people which were in the
      city of Ammonihah, and also some around the borders of Noah, and taking others captive into
      the wilderness. Now it came to pass that the Nephites were desirous to obtain those which had
      been carried away captive into the wilderness; therefore he that had been appointed Chief
      Captain over the armies of the Nephites, (and his name was Zoram, and he had two sons, Lehi
      and Aha:) Now Zoram and his two sons, knowing that Alma was High Priest over the Church, and
      having heard that he had the spirit of Prophecy, therefore they went unto him and desired of
      him to know whether the Lord would that they should go into the wilderness in search of their
      brethren, who had been captive by the Lamanites. And it came to pass that Alma inquired of the
      Lord concerning the matter. And Alma returned and said unto them, Behold the Lamanites will
      cross the river Sidon in the south wilderness, away up beyond the borders of the land of
      Manti. --And behold there shall ye meet them, on the east of the river Sidon, and there the
      Lord will deliver unto thee thy brethren which have been taken captive by the Lamanites. And
      it came to pass that Zoram and his sons crossed over the river Sidon, with their armies, and
      marched away beyond the borders of Manti, into the south wilderness, which was on the east
      side of the river Sidon. And they came upon the armies of the Lamanites, and the Lamanites
      were scattered and driven into the wilderness; and they took their brethren which had been
      taken captive by the Lamanites, and there was not one soul of them which had been lost, that
      were taken captive. And they were brought by their brethren to possess their own lands. And
      thus ended the eleventh year of the Judges, the Lamanites having been driven out of the land,
      and the people of Ammonihah were destroyed; yea, every living soul of the Ammonihahites were
      destroyed , and also their great city, which they said God could not destroy, because of its
      greatness. --But behold, in one day it was left desolate; and their carcases were mangled by
      dogs and wild beasts of the wilderness; nevertheless, after many days, their dead bodies were
      heaped up upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now
      so great was the scent thereof, that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah
      for many years. And it was called desolation of Nehors; for they were of the profession of
      Nehor, which were slain; and their lands remained desolate. And it came to pass that the
      Lamanites did not come again to war against the Nephites until the fourteenth year of the
      reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi. And thus for three years did the people of Nephi
      have continual peace in all the land. And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance unto
      the people in their tempels, and in their sanctuaries, and also in their synagogues, which was
      built after the manner of the Jews. And as many as would hear their words, unto them they did
      impart the word of God, without any respects of persons continually. And thus did Alma and
      Amulek go forth, and also many more which had been chosen for the work, to preach the word
      throughout the land. And the establishment of the Church became general throughout all the
      land, in all the region round about, among all the people of the Nephites. And there was no
      inequality among them, for the Lord did pour out his spirit on all the face of the land, for
      to prepare the minds of the children of men, or to prepare their hearts to receive the word
      which should be taught among them at the time of his coming, that they might not be hardened
      against the word,, that they might not be unbelieving, and go on to destruction, but that they
      might receive the word with joy, and as a branch be grafted into the true vine, that they
      might enter into the rest of the Lord their God. Now those priests which did go forth among
      the people, did preach against all lyings, and deceivings, and envyings, and strifes, and
      malice, and revilings, and stealing, robbing, plundering, murdering, committing adultry, and
      all manner of lasciviousness, crying that these things ought not so to be; holding forth
      things which must shortly come; yea, holding forth the coming of the Son of God, his
      sufferings and death, and also the resurrection of the dead. And many of the people did
      inquire concerning the place where the Son of God should come; and they were taught that he
      would appear unto them after his resurrection; and this the people did hear with great joy and
      gladness. And now after the Church having been established throughout the land, having got the
      victory over the Devil, and the word of God being preached in its purity in all the land; and
      the Lord pouring out his blessings upon the people; and thus ended the fourteenth year of the
      reign of the Judges, over the people of Nephi. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that as Alma was journeying from the land of Gideon, southward,
      away to the land of Manti, behold, to his astonishment, he met with the sons of Mosiah, a
      journeying towards the land of Zarahemla. Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time
      the angel first appeared unto him; therefore Alma did rejoice exceedingly, to see his
      brethren; and what added more to his joy, they were still his brethren in the Lord; yea, and
      they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound
      understanding, and they had searched the Scriptures diligently, that they might know the word
      of God. But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting, therefore
      they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they
      taught with power and authority, even as with the power and authority of God. And they had
      been teaching the word of God for the space of fourteen years, among the Lamanites, having had
      much success in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth; yea, by the power of their words,
      many were brought before the alter of God, to call on his name, and confess their sins before
      him. Now these are the circumstances which attended them in their journeyings, for they had
      many afflictions; they did suffer much, both in body and in mind; such as hunger, thirst and
      fatigue, and also much labor in the spirit. Now these were their journeyings, having taken
      leave of their father Mosiah, in the first year of the reign of the Judges; having refused the
      kingdom which their father was desirous to confer upon them; and also this was the minds of
      the people; nevertheless they departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and took their swords,
      and their spears, and their bows, and their arrows, and their slings; and this they done that
      they might provide food for themselves while in the wilderness: and thus they departed into
      the wilderness, with their numbers which they had selected, to go up to the land of Nephi, to
      preach the word of God unto the Lamanites. And it came to pass that they journeyed many days
      in the wilderness, and they fasted much, and prayed much, that the Lord would grant unto them
      a portion of his spirit to go with them, and abide with them, that they might be an instrument
      in the hands of God, to bring, if it were possible, their brethren, the Lamanites, to the
      knowledge of the truth; to the knowledge of the baseness of the traditions of their fathers,
      which were not correct. And it came to pass that the Lord visit them with his spirit, and said
      unto them, Be comforted; and they were comforted. And the Lord said unto them also, Go forth
      among the Lamanites, thy brethren, and establish my word; yet ye shall be patient in long
      suffering and afflictions, that ye may shew forth good examples unto them in me, and I will
      make an instrument of thee in my hands, unto the salvation of many souls. And it came to pass
      that the hearts of the sons of Mosiah, and also those which were with them, took courage to go
      forth unto the Lamanites, to declare unto them the word of God. And it came to pass when they
      had arriven in the borders of the land of the Lamanites, that they separated themselves, and
      departed one from another, trusting in the Lord, that they should meet again at the close of
      their harvest: for they supposed that great was the work which they had undertaken. --And
      assuredly it was great, for they had undertaken to preach the word of God to a wild, and a
      hardened, and a ferocious people; a people which delighted in the murdering the Nephites, and
      robbing, and plundering them; and their hearts were set upon riches, or upon gold, and silver,
      and precious stones; yet they sought to obtain these things by murdering and plundering, that
      they might not labor for them with their own hands: thus they were a very indolent people,
      many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fell upon them because of the
      traditions of their fathers; notwithstanding, the promises of the Lord were extended unto
      them, on the conditions of repentance; therefore this was the cause for which the sons of
      Mosiah had undertaken the work, that perhaps they might bring them unto repentance; that
      perhaps they might bring them to know of the plan of redemption; therefore they separated
      themselves one from another; and went forth among them every man alone, according to the word
      and power of God, which was given unto him. Now Ammon being the chief among them, or rather he
      did administer unto them; and he departed from them, after having blessed them according to
      their several stations, having imparted the word of God unto them, or administered unto them
      before his departure; and thus they took their several journeys throughout the land. And Ammon
      went to the land of Ishmael, the land being called after the sons of Ishmael, which also
      became Lamanites. And as Ammon entered the land of Ishmael, the Lamanites took him and bound
      him, as was their custom, to bind all the Nephites which fell into their hands, and carry them
      before the king; and thus it was left to the pleasure of the king to slay them, or to retain
      them in captivity, or to cast them into prison, or to cast them out of his land, according to
      his will and pleasure; and thus Ammon was carried before the king which was over the land of
      Ishmael; and his name was Lamoni; and he was a descendant of Ishmael. And the king inquired of
      Ammon if it were desirous to dwell in the land among the Lamanites, or among his people? And
      Ammon said unto him, Yea, I desire to dwell among this people for a time; yea, and perhaps
      until the day I die. And it came to pass that king Lamoni was much pleased with Ammon, and
      caused that his bands should be loosed; and he would that Ammon should take one of his
      daughters to wife. But Ammon saith unto him, Nay, but I will be thy servant; therefore Ammon
      became a servant to king Lamoni. And it came to pass that he was set, among other servants, to
      watch the flocks of Lamoni, according to the custom of the Lamanites. And it came to pass that
      after he had been in the service of the king three days, that as he was, with the Lamanitish
      servants, a going forth with their flocks, to the place of water, which was called the water
      of Sebus; (and all the Lamanites drive their flocks hither, that they might have water;)
      therefore as Ammon and the servants of the king were driving forth their flocks to this place
      of water, behold, a certain number of the Lamanites who had been with their flocks to water,
      stood and scattered the flocks of Ammon, and the servants of the king, and they scattered them
      insomuch that they fled many ways. Now the servants of the king began to murmur, saying: Now
      the king will slay us, as he has our brethren, because their flocks were scattered by the
      wickedness of these men. And they began to weep exceedingly, saying, Behold our flocks are
      scattered already. Now they wept because of the fear of being slain. Now when Ammon saw this,
      his heart was swollen within him, with joy, for, said he, I will shew forth my power unto
      these my fellow servants, or the power which is in me, in restoring these flocks unto the
      king, that I may win the hearts of these my fellow servants, that I may lead them to believe
      in my words. Now these were the thoughts of Ammon, when he saw the afflictions of those which
      he termed to be his brethren. And it came to pass that he flattered them by his words, saying:
      My brethren, be of good cheer and let us go in search of the flocks, and we will gather them
      together, and bring them back unto the place of water; and thus we will reserve the flocks
      unto the king, and he will not slay us. And it came to pass that they went in search of the
      flocks, and they did follow Ammon, and they rushed forth with much swiftness, and did head the
      flocks of the king, and did gather them together again, to the place of water. And those men
      again stood to scatter their flocks; but Ammon saith unto his brethren, Encircle the flocks
      round about, that they flee not; and I go and contend with these men which do scatter our
      flocks. Therefore they did as Ammon commanded them, and he went forth and stood to contend
      with those which stood by the waters of Sebus; and they were not in number a very few;
      therefore they did not fear Ammon, for they supposed that one of their men could slay him,
      according to their pleasure, for they knew not that the Lord had promised Mosiah that he would
      deliver his sons out of their hands; neither did they know any thing concerning the Lord;
      therefore they delighted in the destruction of their brethren; and for this cause they stood
      to scatter the flocks of the king. But Ammon stood forth and began to cast stones at them with
      his sling; yea, with mighty power he did sling stones amongst them; and thus he slew a certain
      number of them, insomuch that they began to be astonished at his power; nevertheless they were
      angry because of the slain of their brethren, and they were determined that he should fall;
      therefore, seeing that they could not hit him with their stones, they came forth with clubs to
      slay him. But behold, every man that lifted his club to smite Ammon, he smote off their arms
      with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his
      sword, insomuch that they began to be astonished, and began to flee before him; yea, and they
      were not few in number; and he caused them to flee by the strength of his arm. Now six of them
      had fallen by the sling, but he slew none save it were their leader; and he smote off as many
      of their arms as was lifted against him, and they were not a few. And when he had driven them
      afar off, he returned, and they watered their flocks and returned them to the pasture of the
      king, and then went in unto the king, bearing the arms which had been smote off by the sword
      of Ammon, of those who sought to slay him; and they were carried in unto the king, for a
      testimony of the things which they had done. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that king Lamoni caused that his servants should stand forth and
      testify to all the things which they had seen concerning the matter. And when they had all
      testified to the things which they had seen, and he had learned of the faithfulness of Ammon
      in preserving his flocks, and also of his great power in contending against those who sought
      to slay him, he was astonished exceedingly, and saith, Surely, this is more than a man.
      Behold, is not this the Great Spirit which doth send such great punishments upon his people,
      because of their murders? And they answered the king, and said, Whether he be the Great Sprit
      or a man, we know not; but this much we do know, that he cannot be slain by the enemies of the
      king; neither can they scatter the king's flocks when he is with us, because of his expertness
      and great strength; therefore, we know that he is a friend to the king. And now, O king, we do
      not believe that a man hath such great power, for we know that he cannot be slain. And now
      when the king heard these words, he said unto them, Now I know that it is the Great Spirit;
      and he hath come down at this time to preserve your lives, that I might not slay you as I did
      your brethren. Now this is the Great Spirit of which our fathers have spoken. Now this was the
      tradition of Lamoni, which he had received from his father, that there was a Great Spirit.
      Notwithstanding they believed in a Great Spirit, they supposed that whatsoever they did, was
      right; nevertheless, Lamoni began to fear exceedingly, with fear lest he had done wrong in
      slaying his servants: for he had slew many of them, because their brethren had scattered their
      flocks at the place of water; and thus because they had their flocks scattered, they were
      slain. Now it was the practice of the Lamanites, to stand by the waters of Sebus, to scatter
      the flocks of the people, that thereby they might drive away many that were scattered, unto
      their own land, it being a practice of plunder among them. And it came to pass that king
      Lamoni inquired of his servants, saying: Where is this man that hath such great power? And
      they said unto him, Behold, he is feeding thy horses. --Now the king had commanded his
      servants previous to the time of the watering of their flocks, that they should prepare his
      horses and chariots, and conduct him forth to the land of Nephi: for their had been a great
      feast appointed at the land of Nephi, by the father of Lamoni, who was king over all the land.
      Now when king Lamoni heard that Ammon was preparing his horses and his chariots, he was more
      astonished, because of the faithfulness of Ammon, saying: Surely, there has not been any
      servant among all my servants, that has been so faithful as this man; for even he doth
      remember all my commandments to execute them. Now I surely know that this is the Great Spirit;
      and I would desire him that he come in unto me, but I durst not. And it came to pass that when
      Ammon had made ready the horses and the chariots for the king and his servants, he went in
      unto the king, and he saw that the countenance of the king was changed; therefore he was about
      to return out of his presence; and one of the king's servants said unto him, Rabbanah, which
      is, being interpreted, powerful, or great king, considering their kings to be powerful; and
      thus he said unto him, Rabbanah, the king desireth thee to stay; therefore, Ammon turned
      himself unto the king, and saith unto him, What will thou that I should do for thee, O king?
      And the king answered him not for the space of an hour, according to their time, for he knew
      not what he should say unto him. And it came to pass that Ammon said unto him again, What
      desireth thou of me? But the king answered him not. And it came to pass that Ammon, being
      filled with the spirit of God, therefore he perceived the thoughts of the king. And he saith
      unto him, It is because that thou hast heard that I defended thy servants and thy flocks, and
      slew seven of their brethren with the sling, and with the sword, and smote off the arms of
      others, in order to defend thy flocks and thy servants; behold, is it this that causeth thy
      marvellings? I say unto you, what is it, that thy marvellings are so great? Behold, I am a
      man, and am thy servant; therefore, whatsoever thou desirest which is right, that will I do.
      Now when the king had heard these words, he marvelled again, for he beheld that Ammon could
      discern his thoughts; notwithstanding this, king Lamoni did open his mouth, and said unto him,
      Who art thou ? Art thou that Great Spirit, which knows all things? Ammon answered and said
      unto him, I am not. And the king saith, How knowest thou the thoughts of my heart? Thou mayest
      speak boldly, and tell me concerning these things; and also tell me by what power ye slew and
      smote off the arms of my brethren, that scattered my flocks. And now if thou wilt tell me
      concerning these things, whatsoever thou desirest, I will give unto thee; and if it were
      needed, I would guard thee with my armies; but I know that thou art more powerful than all
      they; nevertheless, whatsoever thou desirest of me, I will grant it unto thee. Now Ammon being
      wise, yet harmless, he saith unto Lamoni, Wilt thou hearken unto my words, if I tell thee by
      what power I do these things? and this is the thing that I desire of thee. And the king
      answered him, and said, Yea, I will believe all thy words; and thus he was caught with guile.
      And Ammon began to speak unto him with boldness, and said unto him, Believest thou that there
      is a God? And he answered, and said unto him, I do not know what that meaneth. And the Ammon
      saith, Believest thou that there is a Great Spirit? And he saith, Yea. And Ammon saith, This
      is God. And Ammon saith unto him again, Believest thou that this Great Spirit, which is God,
      created all things, which is in Heaven and the Earth? And he saith, Yea, I believe that he
      created all things which is in the earth; but I do not know the Heavens. And Ammon saith unto
      him, The Heavens is a place where God dwells, and all his holy angels. And king Lamoni saith,
      Is it above the earth? And Ammon saith, Yea, and he looketh down upon all the children of men;
      and he knows all the thoughts and intents of the heart: for by his hand were they all created,
      from the beginning. And king Lamoni saith, I believe all these things which thou hast spoken.
      Art thou sent from God? Ammon saith unto him, I am a man; and man in the beginning, was
      created after the image of God; and I am called by his Holy Spirit to teach these things unto
      this people, that they may be brought to a knowledge of that which is just and true; and a
      portion of that Spirit dwelleth in me, which giveth me knowledge, and also power, according to
      my faith and desires which is in God. Now when Ammon had said these words, he began to the
      creation of the world, and also to the creation of Adam, and told him all the things
      concerning the fall of man, and rehearsed and laid before him the records and the Holy
      Scriptures of the people, and which had been spoken by the prophets, even down to the time
      that their father Lehi left Jerusalem; and he also rehearsed unto them (for it was unto the
      king and to his servants,) all the journeyings of their fathers in the wilderness, and all
      their sufferings with hunger and thirst, and their travel, &amp;c; and he also rehearsed
      unto them concerning the rebellions of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, yea, all
      their rebellions did he relate unto them, and he expounded unto them all the records and
      Scriptures, from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem, down to the present time; but this is not
      all, for he expounded unto them the plan of redemption, which was prepared from the foundation
      of the world; and he also made known unto them concerning the coming of Christ; and all the
      works of the Lord did he make known unto them. And it came to pass that after he said all
      these things, and expounded them to the king, that the king believed all his words. And he
      began to cry unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, have mercy; according to thy abundant mercy which
      thou hast had upon the people of Nephi, have upon me and my people. And now when he had said
      this, he fell unto the earth, as if he were dead. And it came to pass that his servants took
      him and carried him in unto his wife, and laid him upon a bed; and he lay as if he were dead,
      for the space of two days and two nights; and his wife, and his sons, and his daughters
      mourned over him, after the manner of the Lamanites, greatly lamenting his loss. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that after two days and two nights, they were about to take his body
      and lay it in a sepulchre which they had made for the purpose of burying their dead. Now the
      queen having heard of the fame of Ammon, therefore she sent and desired that he should come
      unto her. And it came to pass that Ammon did as he was commanded, and went in unto the queen,
      and desired to know what she would that he should do. And she saith unto him, The servants or
      my husband have made it known unto me, that thou art a prophet of a Holy God., and that thou
      hast the power to do many mighty works in his name; therefore, if this is the case, I would
      that ye should go in and see my husband, for he has been laid upon his bed for the space of
      two days and two nights; and some say that he is not dead, but others say that he is dead, and
      that he stinketh, and that he ought to be placed in the sepulchre; but as for myself, to me he
      doth not stink. Now this was what Ammon desired, for he knew that king Lamoni was under the
      power of God; he knew that the dark veil of unbelief being cast away from his mind, and the
      light which did light up his mind, which was the light of the glory of God, which was a
      marvellous light of his goodness; yea, this light had infused such joy into his soul, the
      cloud of darkness having been dispelled, and the light of everlasting light was lit up in his
      soul; yea, he knew that this had overcame his natural frame, and he was carried away in God;
      therefore, what the queen desired of him, was his only desire. Therefore he went in to see the
      king, according as the queen desired him; and he saw the king, and he knew that he was not
      dead. And he saith unto the queen, He is not dead, but he sleepeth in God, and on the morrow
      he shall rise again; therefore bury him not. And Ammon saith unto her, Believest thou this?
      And she asid unto him, I have had no witness, save thy word, and the word of our servants;
      nevertheless, I believe that it shall be according as thou hast said. And Ammon said unto her,
      Blessed art thou, because of thy exceeding faith; I say unto thee, woman, there has not been
      such great faith among all the people of the Nephites. And it came to pass that she watched
      over the bed of her husband, from that time, even until that time on the morrow which Ammon
      had appointed that he should rise. And it came to pass that he arose, according to the words
      of Ammon; and as he arose, he stretched forth his hand unto the woman, and said, Blessed be
      the name of God, and blessed art thou: for as sure as thou livest, behold, I have seen my
      Redeemer; and he shall come forth, and be born of a woman, and he shall redeem all mankind who
      believe on his name. Now when he had said these words , his heart was swollen within him, and
      he sunk again with joy; and the queen also sunk down, being overpowered by the spirit. Now
      Ammon seeing the spirit of the Lord poured out according to his prayers upon the Lamanites,
      his brethren, which had been the cause of so much mourning among the Nephites, or among all
      the people of God, because of their iniquities and their traditions; and Ammon fell upon his
      knees, and began to pour out his soul in prayer and thanksgiving to God, for what he had done
      for his brethren; and he was also overpowered with joy; and thus they all three had sunk to
      the earth. Now when the servants of the king had seen that they had fallen, they also began to
      cry unto God, for the fear of the Lord had come upon them also: for it was they which had
      stood before the king, and testified unto him concerning the great power of Ammon. And it came
      to pass that they did call on the name of the Lord in their might, even until they had fallen
      to the earth, save it were one of the Lamanitish women, whose name was Abish, she having been
      converted unto the Lord for many years, on account of a remarkable vision of her father; thus
      having been converted to the Lord, never had made it known; therefore when she saw that all
      the servants of Lamoni had fallen to the earth, and also her mistress, the queen, and the
      king, and Ammon lay prostrate upon the earth, she knew that it was the power of God; and
      supposing that this opportunity, by making known unto the people what had happened among them,
      that by beholding this scene, it would cause them to believe in the power of God, therefore
      she ran forth from house to house, making it known unto the people; and they began to assemble
      themselves together unto the house of the king. And there came a multitude, and to their
      astonishment, they beheld the king, and the queen, and their servants, prostrate upon the
      earth, and they all lay there as though they were dead; and they also saw Ammon, and behold,
      he was a Nephite. And now the people began to murmur among themselves; some saying, That it
      was a great evil that had come upon them, or upon the king and his house, because he had
      suffered that the Nephite should remain in the land. But others rebuked them, saying, The king
      hath brought this evil upon his house, because he slew his servants who had their flocks
      scattered by those men which had stood at the waters of Sebus, and scattered the flocks which
      belonged to the king, for they were angry with Ammon because of the number which he had slain
      of their brethren at the waters of Sebus, while defending the flocks of the king. Now one of
      them, whose brother had been slain with the sword of Ammon, being exceeding angry with Ammon,
      drew his sword and went forth that he might let it fall upon Ammon, to slay him; and as he
      lifted the sword to smite him, behold, he fell dead. Now we see that Ammon could not be slain,
      for the Lord had said unto Mosiah, his father, I will spare him, and it shall be unto him
      according to thy faith; therefore Mosiah trusted him unto the Lord. And it came to pass that
      when the multitude beheld the man had fell dead, who lifted the sword to slay Ammon, fear came
      upon them all, and they durst not put forth their hands to touch him, or any of those which
      had fallen; and they began to marvel again among themselves, what could be the cause of this
      great power, or what all these things could mean. And it came to pass that there was many
      among them, who said that Ammon was the Great Spirit, and others said he was sent by the Great
      Spirit; but others rebuked them all, saying, That he was a monster, which hath been sent from
      the Nephites to torment us; and there were some which said that Ammon was sent by the Great
      Spirit to afflict them, because of their iniquities, and that it was the Great Spirit that had
      always attended the Nephites, which had ever delivered them out of their hands; and they said
      that it was this Great Spirit which had destroyed so many of their brethren, the Lamanites;
      and thus the contention began to be exceeding sharp among them. And while they were thus
      contending, the woman servant which had caused the multitude to be gathered together came; and
      when she saw the contention which was among the multitude, she was exceeding sorrowful, even
      unto tears. And it came to pass that she went and took the queen by the hand, that perhaps she
      might raise her from the ground; and as soon as she touched her hand, she arose and stood upon
      her feet, and cried with a loud voice, saying: O blessed Jesus, who has saved me from the
      awful hell! O blessed God, have mercy on this people. And when she had said this, she clasped
      her hands, being filled with joy, speaking many words which were not understood; and when she
      had done this, she took the king, Lamoni, by the hand, and behold, he arose and stood upon his
      feet; and he immediately, seeing the contention among his people, went forth and began to
      rebuke them, and to teach them the words which he had heard from the mouth of Ammon; and as
      many as heard his words, believed, and were converted unto the Lord. But there were many among
      them which would not hear his words; therefore they went their way. And it came to pass that
      when Ammon arose, he also administered unto them, and also did all the servants of Lamoni; and
      they did all declare unto the people the self-same thing: and their hearts had been changed;
      that they had no more desire to do evil. And behold, many did declare unto the people that
      they had seen angels, and had conversed with them; and thus they had told them things of God,
      and of his righteousness, And it came to pass that there was many that did believe in their
      words; and as many as did believe, were baptized; and they became a righteous people, and they
      did establish a church among them: and thus the work of the Lord did commence among the
      Lamanites; thus the Lord did begin to pour out his spirit upon them; and we see that his arm
      is extended to all people who will repent and believe on his name. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that when they established a church in that land, that king Lamoni
      desired that Ammon should go with him to the land of Nephi, that he might show unto his
      father. And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to Ammon, saying: Thou shalt not
      go up to the land of Nephi, for behold, the king will seek thy life; but thou shalt go to the
      land of Middoni; for behold, thy brother Aaron, and also Muloki and Ammah are in prison. Now
      it came to pass that when Ammon had heard this, he saith unto Lamoni, Behold, my brother and
      brethren are in prison at Middoni, and I go that I may deliver them. Now Lamoni saith unto
      Ammon, I know, in the strength of the Lord, thou canst do all things. But behold, I will go
      with thee to the land of Middoni; for the king of the land of Middoni, whose name is Antiomno,
      is a friend unto me; therefore I go to the land of Middoni, that I may flatter the king of the
      land; and he will cast thy brethren out of prison. Now Lamoni saith unto him, Who told thee
      that my brethren were in prison? And Ammon saith unto him, No one hath told me, save it be
      God: and he said unto me, Go and deliver thy brethren, for they are in prison in the land of
      Middoni. Now when Lamoni had heard this, he caused that his servants should make ready his
      horses, and his chariots. And he saith unto Ammon, Come, I will go with thee down to the land
      of Middoni, and there I will plead with the king, that he will cast thy brethren out of
      prison. And it came to pass that as Ammon and Lamoni was a journeying thither, that they met
      the father of Lamoni, who was king over all the land. And behold, the father of Lamoni saith
      unto him, Why did ye not come to the feast, on that great day when I made feast unto my sons,
      and unto my people? And he also saith, Whither art thou going with this Nephite, which is one
      of the children of a liar? And it came to pass that Lamoni rehearst unto him whither he was
      going, for he feared to offend him. And he also told him all the cause of his tarrying in his
      own kingdom, that he did not go unto his father, to the feast which he had prepared. And now
      when Lamoni had rehearsed unto him all these things, behold, to his astonishment, his father
      was angry with him, and saith, Lamoni, thou art going to deliver these Nephites, which are the
      sons of a liar. Behold, he robbed our fathers; and now his children are also come amongst us,
      that they may, by their cunning and lyings, deceive us, that they again may rob us of our
      property. Now the father of Lamoni commanded him that he should slay Ammon, with the sword.
      And he also commanded him that he should not go to the land of Middoni, but that he should
      return with him, to the land of Ishmael. But Lamoni saith unto him, I will not slay Ammon,
      neither will I return to the land of Ishmael, but I go to the land of Middoni, that I may
      release the brethren of Ammon, for I know that they are just men, and holy prophets of the
      true God. Now when his father heard these words, he was angry with him, and he drew his sword
      that he might smite him to the earth. But Ammon stood forth and saith unto him, Behold, thou
      shalt not slay thy son; nevertheless, it were better that he should fall than thee: for
      behold, he hath repented of his sins; but if thou shouldst fall at this time, in thine anger,
      thy soul could not be saved. And again: It is expedient that thou shouldst forbear; for if
      thou shouldst slay thy son, (he being and innocent man,) his blood would cry from the ground,
      to the Lord his God, for vengeance to come upon thee; and perhaps thou wouldst lose thy soul.
      Now when Ammon had said these words unto him, he answered him, saying: I know that if I should
      slay my son, that I should shed innocent blood; for it is thou that hast sought to destroy
      him: and he stretched forth his hand to slay Ammon. But Ammon withstood his blows, and also
      smote his arm that he could not use it. Now when the king saw that Ammon could slay him, he
      began to plead with Ammon, that he would spare his life. But Ammon raised his sword, and said
      unto him, Behold, I will smite thee, except thou wilt grant unto me that my brethren may be
      cast out of prison. Now the king, fearing that he should lose his life, said, if thou wilt
      spare me, I will grant unto thee whatsoever thou wilt ask, even to the half of the kingdom.
      Now when Ammon saw that he had wrought upon the old king according to his desire. he saith
      unto him, If thou wilt grant that my brethren may be cast out of prison, and also that Lamoni
      may retain his kingdom, and that ye be not displeased with him, but grant that he may
      according to his own desires, in whatsoever thing he thinketh, and then will I spare thee;
      otherwise I will smite thee to the earth. Now when Ammon had said these words, the king began
      to rejoice because of his life. And when he saw that Ammon had no desires to destroy him, and
      when he also saw the great love he had for his son Lamoni, he was astonished exceedingly, and
      saith, Because this is all that thou hast desired, that I would release thy brethren, and
      suffer that my son Lamoni should retain his kingdom, behold, I will grant unto you that my son
      retain his kingdom from this time and forever; and I will govern him no more. And I will also
      grant unto thee that thy brethren may be cast out of prison, and thou and thy brethren may
      come unto me, in my kingdom; for I shall greatly desire to see thee; for the king was greatly
      astonished at the words which had been spoken, and also at the words which had been spoken by
      his son Lamoni; therefore he was desirous to learn them. And it came to pass that Ammon and
      Lamoni proceeded on their journey towards the land of Middoni. And it came to pass that Lamoni
      found favor in the eyes of the king of the land; therefore the brethren of Ammon was brought
      forth out of prison. And when Ammon did meet them, he was exceeding sorrowful, for behold,
      they were naked, and their skins were worn exceedingly, because of being bound with strong
      cords. And they also had suffered hunger, thirst, and all kind of afflictions; nevertheless
      they were patient in all their sufferings. And as it happened, it was their lot to have fallen
      into the hands of a more hardened and a more stiffnecked people; therefore they would not
      hearken unto their words, and they had cast them out, and had smote them, and had driven them
      from house to house, and from place to place, even until they had arriven to the land of
      Middoni; and there they were taken and cast into prison, and bound with strong cords, and kept
      in prison for many days; and were delivered by Lamoni and Ammon. </text>

    <text> Now when Ammon and his brethren separated themselves in the borders of the land of the
      Lamanites, behold, Aaron took his journey towards the land which was called by the Lamanites,
      Jerusalem; calling it after the land of their fathers' nativity; and it was away joining the
      borders of Mormon. --Now the Lamanites, and the Amalekites, and the people of Amulon, had
      built a great city, which was called Jerusalem. Now the Lamanites, of themselves, were
      sufficiently hardened, but the Amalekites, and the Amulonites, were still harder; therefore
      they did cause the Lamanites that they should harden their hearts, that they should wax
      stronger in wickedness, and their abominations. And it came to pass that Aaron came to the
      city of Jerusalem, and firstly began to preach to the Amalekites. And he began to preach to
      them in their synagogues, for they had built synagogues, after the order of the Nehors; for
      many of the Amalekites and the Amulonites were after the order of the Nehors. Therefore, as
      Aaron entered into one of their synagogues to preach unto the people, and as he was speaking
      unto them, behold there arose an Amalekite, and began to contend with him, saying: What is
      that that thou hast testified? Hast thou seen an angel? Why do not angels appear unto us?
      Behold, art not this people as good as thy people? --Thou also sayest, Except ye repent, we
      shall perish. How knowest thou the thought and intent of our hearts? How knowest thou that we
      have cause to repent? How knowest thou that we are not a righteous people? Behold, we have
      built sanctuaries, and we do assemble ourselves together to worship God. We do believe that
      God will save all men. Now Aaron said unto him, Believest thou that the Son of God shall come
      to redeem mankind from their sins? And the man saith unto him, We do not believe that thou
      knowest any such thing. We do not believe in these foolish traditions. We do not believe that
      thou knowest of things to come, neither do we believe that thy fathers, and also that our
      fathers did know concerning the things which they spake, of that which is to come. Now Aaron
      began to open the Scriptures unto them, concerning the coming of Christ, and also concerning
      the resurrection of the dead, and that there could be no redemption for mankind, save it were
      through the death and sufferings of Christ, and the atonement of his blood. And it came to
      pass that as he began to expound these things unto them, they were angry with him, and began
      to mock him; and they would not hear the words which he spake; therefore, when he saw that
      they would not hear his words, he departed out of the synagogue, and came over to a village
      which was called Ani-anti, and there he found Muloki a preaching the word unto them; and also
      Ammah, and his brethren. And they contended with many about the word. And it came to pass that
      they saw that the people would harden their hearts; therefore they departed, and came over
      into the land of Middoni. And they did preach the word unto many, and few believed on the
      words which they taught. Nevertheless, Aaron, and a certain number of his brethren, were taken
      and cast into prison, and the remainder of them fled out of the land of Middoni, unto the
      regions round about. And those which were cast into prison suffered many things, and they were
      delivered by the hand of Lamoni and Ammon; and they were fed and clothed. And they went forth
      again to declare the word; and thus they were delivered for the first time out of prison; and
      thus they had suffered. And they went forth whithersoever they were led by the spirit of the
      Lord, preaching the word of God in every synagogue of the Amalekites, or in every assembly of
      the Lamanites, where they could be admitted. And it came to pass that the Lord began to bless
      them, insomuch that they brought many to the knowledge of the truth; yea, they did convince
      many of their sins, and of the tradition of their fathers, which were not correct. And it came
      to pass that Ammon and Lamoni returned from the land of Middoni, to the land of Ishmael, which
      was the land of their inheritance. And king Lamoni would not suffer that Ammon should serve
      him, or be his servant; but he caused that there be synagogues built in the land of Ishmael;
      and he caused that his people, or the people which was under his reign, should assemble
      themselves together. And he did rejoice over them, and he did teach them many things. And he
      did also declare unto them that they were a people which was under him, and that they were a
      free people; that they were free from the oppressions of the king, his father; for that his
      father had granted unto him that he might reign over the people which were in the land of
      Ishmael, and in all the land round about. And he also declared unto them that they might have
      the liberty of worshiping the Lord their God, according to their desires, in whatsoever place
      they were in, if it were in the land which was under the reign of king Lamoni. And Ammon did
      preach unto the people of king Lamoni.-- And it came to pass that he did teach them all things
      concerning things pertaining to righteousness. And he did exhort them daily, with all
      diligence; and they gave heed unto his word, and they were zealous for keeping the
      commandments of God. </text>

    <text> Now as Ammon was thus teaching the people of Lamoni continually, we will return to the
      account of Aaron and his brethren; for after he departed from the land of Middoni, he was led
      by the spirit to the land of Nephi; even to the house of the king which was over all the land,
      save it were the land of Ishmael; and he was the father of Lamoni. And it came to pass that he
      went in unto him into the king's palace, with his brethren, and bowed himself before the king,
      and said unto him, Behold, O king, we are the brethren of Ammon, whom thou hast delivered out
      of prison. And now, O king, if thou wilt spare our lives, we will be thy servants. And the
      king saith unto them, Arise, for I will grant unto you your lives, and I will not suffer that
      ye shall be my servants; but I will insist that ye shall administer unto me; for I have been
      somewhat troubled in mind, because of the generosity, and the greatness of the words of thy
      brother Ammon; and I desire to know the cause why he has not come up out of Middoni, with
      thee. And Aaron saith unto the king, Behold, the spirit of the Lord hath called him another
      way: he hath gone to the land of Ishmael, to teach the people of Lamoni. Now the king saith
      unto them, What is this that ye have said concerning the spirit of the Lord? Behold, this is
      the thing which doth trouble me. And also, what is this that Ammon said --if ye will repent ye
      shall be saved, and if ye will not repent, ye shall be cast off at the last day? And Aaron
      answered him and said unto him, Believest thou that there is a God? And the king saith, I know
      that the Amalekites say that there is a God, and I have granted unto them that they should
      build sanctuaries, that they might assemble themselves together, to worship him. And if now
      thou sayest there is a God, behold, I will believe. And now when Aaron heard this, his heart
      began to rejoice, and he saith, Behold, assuredly, as thou livest, O king, there is a God. And
      the king saith, Is God that Great Spirit that brought our fathers out of the land of
      Jerusalem? And Aaron said unto him, Yea, he is that Great Spirit, and he created all things,
      both in Heaven and in earth: believest thou this? --And he saith Yea, I believe that the Great
      Spirit created all things, and I desire that ye should tell me concerning all these things,
      and I will believe thy words. And it came to pass that when Aaron saw that the king would
      believe his words, he began from the creation of Adam, reading the Scriptures unto the king;
      how God created man after his own image, and that God gave him commandments, and that because
      of transgression, man had fallen. And Aaron did expound unto him the Scriptures, from the
      creation of Adam, laying the fall of man before him, and their carnal state, and also the plan
      of redemption, which was prepared from the foundation of the world, through Christ, for all
      whosoever would believe on his name. And since man had fallen, he could not merit any thing of
      himself; but the sufferings and the death of Christ atoneth for their sins, through faith and
      repentance, &amp;c; and that he breaketh the bands of death, that the grave shall have no
      victory, and that the sting of death should be swallowed up in the hopes of glory: and Aaron
      did expound all these things unto the king. And it came to pass that after Aaron had expounded
      these things unto him, the king saith, What shall I do, that I may be born of God, having this
      wicked spirit rooted out of my breast, and receive his spirit, that I may be filled with joy,
      that I may not be cast off at the last day? Behold, saith he, I will give up all that I
      possess; yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may receive this great joy. But Aaron saith
      unto him, if thou desirest this thing, if thou wilt bow down before God, yea, if thou repent
      of all thy sins, and will bow down before God, and call. on his name in faith, believing that
      ye shall receive, then shalt thou receive the hope which thou desirest. And it came to pass
      that when Aaron had said these words, the king did bow down before the Lord, upon his knees;
      yea, even he did prostrate himself upon the earth, and cried mightily, saying, O God, Aaron
      hath told me that there is a God; and if there is a God, and if thou art God, wilt thou make
      thyself known unto me, and I will give away all my sins to know thee, and that I may be raised
      from the dead, and be saved at the last day. And now when the king had said these words, he
      was struck as if he were dead. And it came to pass that his servants ran and told the queen
      all that had happened unto the king. And she came in unto the king; and when she saw him lay
      as if he were dead, and also Aaron and his brethren standing as though they had been the cause
      of his fall, she was angry with them, and commanded that her servants, or the servants of the
      king, should take them and slay them. Now the servants had seen the cause of the king's fall,
      therefore they durst not lay their hands on Aaron and his brethren; and they plead with the
      queen, saying, Why commandest thou that we should slay these men, when behold, one of them is
      mightier than us all? Therefore we shall fall before them. Now when the queen saw the fear of
      the servants, she also began to fear exceedingly, lest there should some evil come upon her.
      And she commanded her servants that they should go and call the people, that they might slay
      Aaron and his brethren. Now when Aaron saw the determination of the queen, and he also knowing
      the hardness of the hearts of the people, feared lest that a multitude should assemble
      themselves together, and there should be a great contention, and a disturbance among them;
      therefore he put forth his hand and raised the king from the earth, and said unto him, Stand:
      and he stood upon his feet, receiving his strength. Now this was done in the presence of the
      queen, and many of the servants. And when they saw it, they greatly marvelled, and began to
      fear. And the king stood forth and began to minister unto them. And he did minister unto them
      insomuch that his whole household were converted unto the Lord. Now there was a multitude
      gathered together because of the commandment of the queen, and there began to be great
      murmurings among them, because of Aaron and his brethren. But the king stood forth among them,
      and administered unto them. And it came to pass that they were pacified towards Aaron, and
      those which were with him. And it came to pass that when the king saw that the people were
      pacified, he caused that Aaron and his brethren should stand forth in the midst of the
      multitude, and that they should preach the word unto them. And it came to pass that the king
      sent a proclamation throughout all the land, amongst all his people which was in all his land,
      which was in all the regions round about, which was bordering even to the sea, on the east,
      and on the west, and which was divided from the land of Zarahemla by a narrow strip of
      wilderness, which ran from the sea, east, even to the sea west, and round about on the borders
      of the sea shore, and the borders of the wilderness which was on the north, by the land of
      Zarahemla, through the borders of Manti, by the head of the river Sidon, running from the east
      towards the west; and thus were the Lamanites and the Nephites divided. Now the more idle part
      of the Lamanites lived in the wilderness, and dwelt in tents; and they were spread through the
      wilderness, on the west, in the land of Nephi; yea, and also on the west of the land of
      Zarahemla, in the borders, by the seashore, and on the west, in the land of Nephi, in the
      place of their fathers' first inheritance; and thus bordering along the seashore. And also
      there was many Lamanites on the east by the seashore, whither the Nephites had driven them.
      And thus the Nephites were nearly surrounded by the Lamanites; nevertheless the Nephites had
      taken possession of all the northern parts of the land, bordering on the wilderness, at the
      head of the river Sidon, from the east to the west, round about on the wilderness side; on the
      north, even until they came to the land which they called Bountiful. And it bordered upon the
      land which they called Desolation; it being so far northward that it came into the land which
      had been peopled, and had been destroyed of whose bones we have spoken, which was discovered
      by the people of Zarahemla; it being the place of their first landing. And they came from
      there up into the south wilderness. Thus the land on the northward was called Desolation, and
      the land on the southward was called Bountiful; it being the wilderness which was filled with
      all manner of wild animals of every kind; a part of which had come from the land northward,
      for food. And now it was only the distance of a day and a half's journey for a Nephite, on the
      line Bountiful, and the land Desolation, from the East to the West sea; and thus the land of
      Nephi, and the land of Zarahemla, was surrounded by water; there being a small, neck of land
      between the land northward, and the land southward. And it came to pass that the Nephites had
      inhabited the land Bountiful, even from the East unto the West sea, and thus the Nephites in
      their wisdom, with their guards and their armies, had hemmed in the Lamanites on the south,
      that thereby they should have no more possession on the north, that they might overrun the
      land northward; therefore the Lamanites could have no more possessions only in the land of
      Nephi, and the wilderness round about. Now this was wisdom in the Nephites, as the Lamanites
      were an enemy to them, they would not suffer their afflictions on every hand, and also that
      they might have a country whither they might flee, according to their desires. And now I,
      after having said this, return again to the account of Ammon, and Aaron, Omner and Himni, and
      their brethren. </text>

    <text> Behold, now it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites sent a proclamation among all
      his people, that they should not lay their hands on Ammon or Aaron, or Omner, or Himni, nor
      neither of their brethren which should go forth preaching the word of God, in whatsoever place
      they should be, in any part of the land; yea, he sent a decree among them, that they should
      not lay their hands on them to bind them, or to cast them into prison; neither should they
      spit upon them, nor smite them, nor cast them out of their synagogues, nor scourge them;
      neither should they cast stones at them, but that they should have free access to their
      houses, and also their temples, and their sanctuaries; and thus they might go forth and preach
      the word according to their desires, for the king had been converted unto the Lord, and all
      his household; therefore he seat this proclamation throughout the land unto his people, that
      the word of God might have no obstruction, but that it might go forth throughout all the land,
      that his people might be convinced concerning the wicked traditions of their fathers, and that
      they might be convinced that they were all brethren, and that they had not ought to murder,
      nor to plunder, nor to steal, nor to commit adultery, not to commit any manner of wickedness.
      And now it came to pass that when the king had sent forth this proclamation, that Aaron and
      his brethren went forth from city to city, and from one house of worship to another,
      establishing churches, and consecrating priests and teachers throughout the land among the
      Lamanites, to preach and to teach the word of God among them; and thus they began to have
      great success. And thousands were brought to the knowledge of the Lord, yea, thousands were
      brought to believe in the traditions of the Nephites; and they were taught the records and the
      prophecies which were handed down, even to the present time; and as sure as the Lord liveth,
      so sure as many as believed, or as many as were brought to the knowledge of the truth, through
      the preaching of Ammon and his brethren, according to the spirit of revelation and of
      prophecy, and the power of God, working miracles in them; yea, I say unto you, as the Lord
      liveth, as many of the Lamanites as believed in their preaching, and were converted unto the
      Lord, never did fall away, for they became a righteous people; they did lay down the weapons
      of their rebellion, that they did not fight against God no more, neither against any of their
      brethren. --Now these are they which were converted unto the Lord: The people of the Lamanites
      which were in the land of Ishmael, and also the people of the Lamanites which were in the land
      of Middoni, and also of the people of the Lamanites which were in the city of Nephi, and also
      of the people of the Lamanites which were in the land of Shilom, and which were in the land of
      Shemlon, and in the city of Lemuel, and the city of Shimnilom; and these are the names of the
      cities of the Lamanites which were converted unto the Lord; and these are they that laid down
      the weapons of their rebellion, yea, all their weapons of war; and they were all Lamanites.
      And the Amalekites were not converted, save only one; neither was any of the Amulonites; but
      they did harden their hearts, and also the hearts of the Lamanites in that part of the land
      whithersoever they dwelt; yea, and all their villages and all their cities; therefore we have
      named all the cities of the Lamanites in which they did repent and come to the knowledge of
      the truth, and were converted. And now it came to pass that the king and those people which
      were converted, were desirous that they might have a name, that thereby they might be
      distinguished from their brethren; therefore the king consulted with Aaron and many of their
      priests, concerning the name that they should take upon them, that they might be
      distinguished. And it came to pass that they called their name Anti-Nephi-Lehies; and they
      were called by this name, and were no more called Lamanites. And they began to be a very
      industrious people; yea, and they were friendly with the Nephites; therefore they did open a
      correspondence with them, and the curse of God did no more follow them. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that the Amalekites, and the Amulonites, and the Lamanites which were
      in the land of Amulon, and also in the land of Helam, and which was in the land of Jerusalem,
      and in fine, in all the land round about, which had not been converted, and had not taken upon
      them the name of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, were stirred up by the Amalekites, and by the Amulonites, to
      anger against their brethren; and their hatred became exceeding sore against them, even
      insomuch that they began to rebel against their king, insomuch that they would not that he
      should be their king; therefore they took up arms against the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi. Now
      the king conferred the kingdom upon his son; and he called his name Anti-Nephi-Lehi. And the
      king died in that self-same year that the Lamanites began to make preparation for war against
      the people of God. Now when Ammon and his brethren, and all those which had come up with him,
      saw the preparations of the Lamanites to destroy their brethren, they came forth to the land
      of Midian, and there Ammon met all his brethren; and from thence they came to the land of
      Ishmael, that they might hold a council with Lamoni, and also with his brother
      Anti-Nephi-Lehi, what they should do to defend themselves against the Lamanites. Now there was
      not one soul among all the people which had been converted unto the Lord, that would take up
      arms against their brethren; nay, they would not even make any preparations for war; yea, and
      also their king commanded them that they should not. Now these are the words which he said
      unto the people concerning the matter: I thank my God, my beloved people, that our great God
      has in goodness sent these our brethren, the Nephites, unto us to preach unto us, and to
      convince us of the traditions of our wicked fathers. And behold, I thank my great God that he
      has given us a portion of his spirit to soften our hearts, that we have opened a
      correspondence with these brethren, the Nephites; and behold, I also thank my God that by
      opening this correspondence, we have been convinced of our sins, and of the many murders which
      we have committed; and I also thank my God, yea, my great God, that he hath granted unto us
      that we might repent of these things, and also that he hath forgiven us those many sins and
      murders which we have committed, and took away the guilt from our hearts, through the merits
      of his Son. And now behold, my brethren, since it has been all that we could so, (as we were
      the most lost of all mankind,) to repent of all our sins and the many murders which we have
      committed, and to get God to take them away from our hearts, for it was all we could do to
      repent sufficiently before God, that he would take away our stain. Now my best beloved
      brethren, since God hath taken away our stains, and our swords have become bright, and let us
      stain our swords no more with the blood of our brethren. Behold, I say unto you, Nay, let us
      retain our swords, that they be not stained with the blood of our brethren: for perhaps, if we
      should stain our swords again, they can no more be washed bright through the blood of the Son
      of our great God, which shall be shed for the atonement of our sins. And the great God has had
      mercy on us, and made these things known unto us, that we might not perish; yea, and he hath
      made these things known unto us beforehand, because he loveth our souls as well as he loveth
      our children; therefore in his mercy he doth visit us by his angels, that the plan of
      salvation might be made known unto us as well as unto future generations. O how merciful is
      our God! And now behold, since it has been as much as we could do to get our stains taken away
      from us, and our swords are made bright, let us hide them away that they may be kept bright,
      as a testimony to our God at the last day, or at the day that we shall be brought to stand
      before him to be judged, that we have not stained our swords in the blood of our brethren
      since he imparted his word unto us, and has made us clean thereby. And now my brethren, if our
      brethren seek to destroy us, behold, we will hide away our swords, yea, even we will bury them
      deep in the earth, that they may be kept bright, as a testimony that we have never used them,
      at the last day; and if our brethren destroy us, behold, we shall go to our God, and shall be
      saved. And now it came to pass that when the king had made an end of these sayings, and all
      the people were assembled together, they took their swords, and all the weapons which were
      used for the shedding of man's blood, and they did bury them up deep in the earth; and this
      they did, it being in their view a testimony to God, and also to men, that they never use
      weapons again for the shedding of man's blood; and this they did, vouching and covenanting
      with God, that rather than to shed the blood of their brethren, they would give up their own
      lives; and rather than to take away from a brother, they would give unto him; and rather than
      to spend their days in idleness, they would labor abundantly with theit hands; and thus we see
      that when these Lamanites were brought to believe and to know the truth, that they were firm,
      and would suffer even unto death, rather than to commit sin; and thus we see, that they buried
      the weapons of peace, or they buried the weapons of war, for peace. And it came to pass that
      their brethren, the Lamanites made preparations for war, and came up to the land of Nephi, for
      the purpose of destroying the king, and to place another in his stead, and also of destroying
      the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi out of the land. And it came to pass that when the people saw
      that they were coming against them, they went out to meet them, and prostrated themselves
      before them to the earth, and began to call on the name of the Lord; and thus they were in
      this attitude, when the Lamanites began to fall upon them, and began to slay them with the
      sword; and thus without meeting any resistance, they did slay a thousand and five of them; and
      we know that they were blessed, for they have gone to dwell with their God. Now when the
      Lamanites saw that their brethren would not flee from the sword neither would they turn aside
      to the right hand or to the left, but that they would lay down and perish, and praised God
      even in the very act of perishing under the sword; now when the Lamanites saw this, they did
      forbear from slaying them; and there were many whose hearts had swollen in them for those of
      their brethren who had fallen under the sword, for they repented of the things which they had
      done. And it came to pass that they threw down their weapons of war, and they would not take
      them again, for they were stung for the murders which they had committed; and they came down
      even as their brethren, relying upon the mercies of those whose arms were lifted to slay them.
      And it came to pass that the people of God were joined that day by more than the number which
      had been slain; and those which had been slain, were righteous people; therefore we have no
      reason to doubt but what they were saved. And there was not a wicked man slain among them; but
      there were more than a thousand brought to the knowledge of the truth; thus we see that the
      Lord worketh in many ways to the salvation of his people. Now the greatest number of those of
      the Lamanites which slew so many of their brethren, were Amalekites and Amulonites, the
      greatest number of whom were after the order of the Nehors. Now among those which joined the
      people of the Lord, there were none which were Amalekites or Amulonites, or which were of the
      order of Nehor, but they were actual descendants of Laman and Lemuel; and thus we can plainly
      discern, that after a people has been once enlightened by the spirit of God, and hath had
      great knowledge of things pertaining to righteousness, and then have fallen away into sin and
      transgression, they become more hardened, and thus their estate becometh worse than as though
      they had never known these things. </text>

    <text> And behold, now it came to pass that those Lamanites were more angry, because they had
      slain their brethren; therefore they swore vengeance upon the Nephites; and they did no more
      attempt to slay the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi at that time; but they took their armies and
      went over into the borders of the land of Zarahemla, and fell upon the people which were in
      the land of Ammonihah, and destroyed them. And after that, they had many battles with the
      Nephites, in the which they were driven and slain, and among the Lamanites which were slain,
      were almost all the seed of Amulon and his brethren, which were the priests of Noah, and they
      were slain by the hands of the Nephites; and the remainder having fled into the east
      wilderness, and having usurped the power and authority over the Lamanites, caused that many of
      the Lamanites should perish by fire, because of their belief: for many of them, after having
      suffered much loss and so many afflictions, they began to be stirred up in remembrance of the
      words which Aaron and his brethren had preached to them in their land; therefore they began to
      disbelieve the traditions of their fathers, and to believe in the Lord, and that he gave great
      power unto the Nephites; and thus there were many of them converted in the wilderness. And it
      came to pass that those rulers which were the remnant of the children of Amulon, caused that
      they should be put to death, yea, all those that believed in these things. Now this martyrdom
      caused that many of their brethren should be stirred up to anger; and there began to be
      contention in the wilderness; and the Lamanites began to hunt the seed of Amulon and his
      brethren, and began to slay them, and they fled into the east wilderness. And behold, they are
      hunted at this day, by the Lamanites: thus the words of Abinadi was brought to pass, which he
      said concerning the seed of the priests which caused that he should suffer by fire. For he
      said unto them, What ye shall do unto me, shall be a type of things to come. And now Abinadi
      was the first that suffered death by fire, because of his belief in God: now this is what he
      meant, that many should suffer death by fire, according as he had suffered. And he said unto
      the priests of Noah, That their seed should cause many to be put to death, in the like manner
      as he was, and that they should be scattered abroad and slain, even as a sheep having no
      shepherd is driven and slain by wild beasts: and now behold, these words were verified, for
      they were driven by the Lamanites, and they were hunted, and were smitten. And it came to pass
      when the Lamanites saw that they could not overpower the Nephites, they returned again to
      their own land; and many of them came over to dwell in the land of Ishmael and the land of
      Nephi, and did join themselves to the people of God, which was the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi;
      and they did also bury their weapons of war, according as their brethren had, and they began
      to be a righteous people; and they did walk in the ways of the Lord, and did observe to keep
      his commandments, and his statutes, yea, and they did keep the law of Moses: for it was
      expedient that they should keep the law of Moses as yet, for it was not all fulfilled. But
      notwithstanding the law of Moses, they did look forward to the coming of Christ, considering
      that the law of Moses was a type of his coming, and believing that they must keep those
      outward performances, until the time that he should be revealed unto them. Now they did not
      suppose that salvation came by the law of Moses; but the law of Moses did serve to strengthen
      their faith in Christ; and thus they did retain a hope through faith, unto eternal salvation,
      relying upon the spirit of prophecy, which spake of those things to come. And now behold,
      Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni, and their brethren, did rejoice exceedingly, for the
      success which they had had among the Lamanites, seeing that the Lord granted unto them
      according to their prayers, and that he had also verified his word unto them in every
      particular. </text>

    <text> And now, these are the words of Ammon to his brethren, which sayeth thus: My brothers and
      my brethren, behold I say unto you, how great reason have we to rejoice; for could we have
      supposed, when we started from the land of Zarahemla, that God would have granted unto us such
      great blessings? And now I ask, What great blessings hath he bestowed upon us? Can ye tell?
      Behold, I answer for you, for our brethren, the Lamanites, were in darkness, yea, even in the
      darkest abyss; but behold, how many of them are brought to behold the marvellous light of God!
      And this is the blessing which hath been bestowed upon us, that we have been made instruments
      in the hands of God, to bring about this great work. Behold, thousands of them do rejoice, and
      have been brought into the fold of God. Behold, the field was ripe, and blessed are ye, for ye
      did thrust in the sickle, and did reap with your mights, yea, all the day long did ye labor;
      and behold the number of your sheaves, and they shall be gathered into the garners, that they
      are not wasted; yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm, at the last day; yea, neither
      shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but when the storm cometh, they shall be gathered
      together in their place, that the storm cannot penetrate to them; yea, neither shall they be
      driven with fierce winds, whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them. But behold, they are
      in the hands of the Lord of the harvest, and they are his; and he will raise them up at the
      last day. Blessed be the name of our God; let us sing to his praise, yea, let us give thanks
      to his holy name, for he doth work righteousness forever. For if we had not come up out of the
      land of Zarahemla, these our dearly beloved brethren, which have so dearly loved us, would
      still have been racked with hatred against us, yea, and they would also have been strangers to
      God. And it came to pass that when Ammon had said these words, his brother Aaron rebuked him
      saying: Ammon, I fear thy joy doth carry thee away unto boasting. But Ammon saith unto him, I
      do not boast in my own strength, or in my own wisdom; but behold, my joy is full, yea, my
      heart is brim with joy, and I will rejoice in my God; yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my
      strength, I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God; for in
      his strength I can do all things; yea, behold, many mighty miracles we have wrought in this
      land, for which we will praise his name forever. Behold, how many thousands of our brethren
      hath he loosed from the pains of hell; and they are brought to sing redeeming love; and this
      because of the power of his word which is in us; therefore have we not great reason to
      rejoice? Yea, we have reason to praise him forever, for he is the Most High God, and has
      loosed our brethren from the chains of hell. Yea, they were encircled about with everlasting
      darkness and destruction; but behold, he hath brought them into his everlasting light, yea,
      into everlasting salvation; and they are encircled about with the matchless bounty of his
      love; yea, and we have been instruments in his hands, of doing this great and marvellous work;
      therefore let us rejoice, for our joy is full; yea, we will praise our God forever. Behold,
      who can glory too much in the Lord? Yea, who can say too much of his great power, and of his
      mercy, and of his long suffering towards the children of men? Behold I say unto you, I cannot
      say the smallest part which I feel. Who could have supposed that our God would have been so
      merciful as to have snatched us from our awful, sinful, and polluted state? Behold, we went
      forth even in wrath, with mighty threatnings to destroy this church. O then, why did he not
      consign us to an awful destruction; yea, why did he not let the sword of his justice fall upon
      us, and doom us to eternal despair? O my soul, almost as it were, fleeth at the thought.
      Behold, he did not exercise his justice upon us, but in his great mercy hath brought us over
      that everlasting gulf of death and misery, even to the salvation of our souls. And now behold,
      my brethren, what natural man is there, that knoweth these things? I say unto you, There is
      none that knoweth these things, save it be the penitent; yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth
      faith, and bringeth forth good works, and prayeth continually without ceasing: unto such it is
      given the mysteries of God; yea, unto such it shall be given to reveal things which never have
      been revealed; yea, and it shall be given unto such, to bring thousands of souls to
      repentance, even as it hath been given unto us to bring these our brethren to repentance. Now
      do ye remember, my brethren, that we said unto our brethren in the land of Zarahemla, We go up
      to the land of Nephi, to preach unto our brethren, the Lamanites, and they laughed us to
      scorn? For they said unto us, Do ye suppose that ye can bring the Lamanites to the knowledge
      of the truth? Do ye suppose that ye can convince the Lamanites of the incorrectness of the
      traditions of their fathers, as stiffnecked a people as they are; whose hearts delighteth in
      the shedding of blood; whose days have been spent in the grossest iniquity; whose ways have
      been the ways of a transgressor, from the beginning? Now my brethren, ye remember that this
      was their language- And moreover, they did say, Let us take up arms against them, that we
      destroy them and their iniquity out of the land, lest they overrun us and destroy us. But
      behold, my beloved brethren, we came into the wilderness not with the intent to destroy our
      brethren but with the intent that perhaps we might save some few of their souls. Now when our
      hearts were depressed, and we were about to turn back, behold, the Lord comforted us, and
      said, Go amongst thy brethren, the Lamanites, and bear with patience thine afflictions, and I
      will give unto the success. And now behold, we have come, and been forth amongst them; and we
      have been patient in our sufferings and we have suffered every privation; yea, we have
      travelled from house to house, relying upon the mercies of the world; not upon the mercies of
      the world alone, but upon the mercies of God; and we have entered into their houses and taught
      them in their streets; yea, and we have taught them upon their hills; and we have also entered
      into their temples and their synagogues and taught them; and we have been cast out, and
      mocked, and spit upon, and smote upon our cheeks; and we have been stoned, and taken and bound
      with cords, and cast into prison; and through the power and wisdom of God, we have been
      delivered again; and we have suffered all manner of afflictions, and all this, that perhaps we
      might be the means of saving some soul; and we supposed that our joy would be full, if perhaps
      we could be the means of saving some. Now behold, we can look forth and see the fruits of our
      labors; and are they few? I say unto you, Nay, they are many; yea, and we can witness of their
      sincerity, because of their love towards their brethren, and also towards us. For behold, they
      had rather sacrifice their lives than even to take the life of their enemy; and they have
      buried their weapons of war deep in the earth, because of their love towards their brethren.
      And now behold I say unto you, Has there been so great love in all the land? Behold, I say
      unto you, Nay, there has not even among the Nephites. For behold, they would take up arms
      against their brethren; they would not suffer themselves to be slain. But behold, how many of
      these have laid down their lives; and we know that they have gone to their God, because of
      their love, and of their hatred to sin. Now have we not reason to rejoice? Yea, I say unto
      you, There never was men that had so great reason to rejoice as we, since the world began;
      yea, and my joy is carried away, even unto boasting in my God; for he has all the power, all
      wisdom, and all understanding; he comprehendeth all things, and he is a merciful Being, even
      unto salvation, to those who will repent and believe on his name. Now if this is boasting,
      even so will I boast; for this is my life and my light, my joy and my salvation, and my
      redemption from everlasting wo. Yea, blessed is the name of my God, who hath been mindful of
      this people, which are a branch of the tree of Israel, and hath been lost from its body, in a
      strange land; yea, I say, blessed be the name of my God, who hath been mindful of us wanderers
      in a strange land. Now my brethren, we see that God is mindful of every people, in whatsoever
      land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his people, and his bowels of mercy is over all the
      earth. Now this is my joy, and my great thanksgiving; yea, and I will give thanks unto my God
      forever. Amen. </text>

    <text> Now it came to pass that when those Lamanites which had gone to war against the Nephites,
      had found after their many struggles for to destroy them, that it was in vain to seek their
      destruction, they returned again to the land of Nephi. And it came to pass that the
      Amalekites, because of their loss, were exceeding angry. And when they saw that they could not
      seek revenge from the Nephites, they began to stir up the people in anger against their
      brethren, the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi; therefore they began again to destroy them. Now this
      people again rufused to take their arms, and they suffered themselves to be slain according to
      the desires of their enemies. Now when Ammon and his brethren saw this work of destruction
      among those who they so dearly loved, and among those who had so dearly loved them; for they
      were treated as though they were angels sent from God to save them from everlasting
      destruction; therefore, when Ammon and his brethren saw this great work of destruction, they
      were moved with compassion, and they said unto the king, Let us gather together this people of
      the Lord, and let us go down to the land of Zarahemla, to our brethren, the Nephites, and flee
      out of the hands of our enemies, that we be not destroyed. But the king saith unto them,
      Behold, the Nephites will destroy us, because of the many murders and sins we have committed
      against them. And Ammon saith, I will go and inquire of the Lord, and if he saith unto us, Go
      down unto our brethren, will ye go? And the king saith unto him Yea; if the Lord saith unto us
      Go, we will go down unto our brethren, and we will be their slaves until we repair unto them
      the many murders and sins which we have committed against them. But Ammon saith unto him, It
      is against the law of our brethren, which was established by my father, that there should be
      any slaves among them; therefore let us go down and rely upon the mercies of our brethren. But
      the king saith unto him, Inquire of the Lord, and if he saith unto us Go, we will go;
      otherwise we will perish in the land. And it came to pass that Ammon went and inquired of the
      Lord, and the Lord said unto him, Get this people out of this land, that they perish not, for
      Satan hath great hold on the hearts of the Amalekites, which do stir up the Lamanites to anger
      against their brethren, to slay them; therefore get thee out of this land; and blessed art
      this people in this generation; for I will preserve them. And now it came to pass that Ammon
      went and told the king all the words which the Lord had said unto him. And it came to pass
      that they gathered together all their people; yea, all the people of the Lord, and did gather
      together all their flocks and herds, and departed out of the land, and came into the
      wilderness which divided the land of Nephi from the land of Zarahemla, and came over near the
      borders of the land. And it came to pass that Ammon saith unto them, Behold, I and my brethren
      will go forth into the land of Zarahemla, and ye shall remain here until we return; and we
      will try the hearts of our brethren, whether they will that ye shall come into their land. And
      it came to pass that as Ammon was going forth into the land, that he and his brethren met
      Alma, over in the place of which has been spoken; and behold, this was a joyful meeting. Now
      the joy of Ammon was great, even that he was full; yea, he was swallowed up in the joy of his
      God, even to the exhausting of his strength; and he fell again to the earth. Now was not this
      exceeding joy? Behold, this is joy which none receiveth save it be the truly penitent and
      humble seeker of happiness. Now the joy of Alma in meeting his brethren was truly great, and
      also the joy of Aaron, of Omner, and Himni; but behold, their joy was not that to exceed their
      strength. Now it came to pass that Alma conducted his brethren back to the land of Zarahemla,
      even to his own house. And it came to pass that they went and told the Chief Judge all the
      things that had happened unto them in the land of Nephi among their brethren, the Lamanites.
      And it came to pass that the Chief Judge sent a proclamation throughout all the land, desiring
      the voice of the people concerning the admitting their brethren, which were the people of
      Anti-Nephi-Lehi. And it came to pass that the voice of the people came saying, Behold, we will
      give up the land of Jershon, which is on the east by the sea, which joins the land Bountiful,
      which is on the south of the land of Bountiful; and this land Jershon is the land which we
      will give unto our brethren, for an inheritance. And behold, we will set our armies between
      the land of Jershon and the land of Nephi, that we may protect our brethren in the land of
      Jershon; and this we do for our brethren, on account of their fear to take up arms against
      their brethren, lest they should commit sin; and this their great fear came, because of their
      sore repentance which they had, on account of their many murders, and their awful wickedness.
      And now behold, this will we do unto out brethren, that they may inherit the land of Jershon;
      and we will guard them from their enemies with our armies, on conditions that they will give
      us a portion of their substance to assist us, that we may maintain our armies. Now it came to
      pass that when Ammon heard this, he returned to the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, and also Alma
      with him, into the wilderness, where they had pitched their tents, and made known unto them
      all these things. And Alma also related unto them his conversion with Ammon, and Aaron, and
      his brethren. And it came to pass that it did cause great joy among them. And it came to pass
      that they went down into the land of Jershon, and took possession of the land of Jershon, and
      they were called by the Nephites the people of Ammon; therefore they were distinguished by
      that name ever after; and they were among the people of Nephi, and also numbered among the
      people which were of the Church of God. And they were also distinguished for their zeal
      towards God, and also towards men; for they were perfectly honest and upright in all things;
      and they were firm in the faith of Christ, even unto the end. And they did look upon shedding
      the blood of their brethren with the great abhorrence; and they never could be prevailed upon
      to take up arms against their brethren; and they never did look upon death with any degree of
      terror for their hope and views of Christ and the resurrection; therefore death was swallowed
      up to them by the victory of Christ over it; therefore they would suffer death in the most
      aggravating and distressing manner which could be inflicted by their brethren, before they
      would take the sword or the cimeter to smite them. And thus they were a zealous and beloved
      people, a highly favored people of the Lord. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that after the people of Ammon were established in the land of
      Jershon, and a church also established in the land of Jershon; and the armies of the Nephites
      were set round about the land of Jershon; yea, in all the borders round about the land of
      Zarahemla; behold the armies of the Lamanites had followed their brethren into the wilderness.
      And thus a tremendous battle; yea, even such an one as never had been known among all the
      people, in the land from the time Lehi left Jerusalem; yea, and tens of thousands of the
      Lamanites were slain and scattered abroad. Yea, and also there was a tremendous slaughter
      among the people of Nephi, nevertheless, the Lamanites were driven and scattered, and the
      people of Nephi returned again to their land. --And now this was a time that there was a great
      mourning and lamentation heard throughout all the land, among all the people of Nephi; yea,
      the cry of widows mourning for their husbands, and also fathers mourning for their sons, and
      the daughter for the brother; yea, the brother for the father: and thus the cry of mourning
      was heard among every one of them; mourning for their kindred which had been slain. And now
      surely this was a sorrowful day; yea, a time of solemnity, and a time of much fasting and
      prayer: and thus ended the fifteenth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi;
      and this is the account of Ammon and his brethren, their journeyings in the land of Nephi,
      their sufferings in the land, their sorrows, and their afflictions, and their incomprehensible
      joy, and the reception and safety of the brethren in the land of Jershon. And now may the
      Lord, the Redeemer of all men, bless their souls forever. And this is the account of the wars
      and contentions among the Nephites, and also the wars between the Nephites and the Lamanites;
      and the fifteenth year of the reign of the Judges is ended; and from the first year to the
      fifteenth, has brought to pass the destruction of many thousand lives; yea, it has brought to
      pass an awful scene of bloodshed; and the bodies of many thousands are laid low in the earth,
      while the bodies of many thousands are mouldering in heaps upon the face of the earth; yea,
      and many thousands are mourning for the loss of their kindred, because they have reason to
      fear, according to the promises of the Lord, that they are consigned to a state of endless wo;
      while many thousands of others truly mourn for the loss of their kindred, yet they rejoice and
      exult in the hope, and even know, according to the promises of the Lord, that ye are raised to
      dwell at the right hand of God, in a state of never ending happiness: and thus we see how
      great the iniquity of man is because of sin and transgression, and the power of the Devil,
      which comes by the cunning plans which he hath devised to ensnare the hearts of men; and thus
      we see the great call of diligence of men to labor in the vineyards of the Lord; and thus we
      see the great reason of sorrow, and also of rejoicing: sorrow because of death and destruction
      among men, and joy because of the light of Christ unto life. </text>

    <text> O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I might go forth and
      speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every
      people; yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder, Repentance, and
      the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come unto God, that there might not be no
      more sorrow upon all the face of the earth. But behold, I am a man, and do sin in my wish; for
      I had ought to be content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me. I had not
      ought to harrow up in my desires, the firm decree of a just God, for I know that he granteth
      unto men according to their desires, whether it be unto death or unto life; yea, I know that
      he allotteth unto men, yea, decreeth unto them decrees which are unalterable, according to
      their wills; whether it be unto salvation or unto destruction; yea, and I know that good and
      evil hath come before all men; or he that knoweth not good from evil, is blameless; but he
      that knoweth good and evil, to him it is given according to his desires; whether he desireth
      good or evil, life or death, joy or remorse of conscience. Now seeing that I know these
      things, why should I desire more than to perform the work to which I have been called? Why
      should I desire that I was an angel, that I could speak unto all the ends of the earth? --For
      behold, the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation and tongue, to teach his
      word; yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth fit that they should have; therefore we see that the
      Lord doth counsel in wisdom, according to that which is just and true. I know that which the
      Lord commanded me, and I glory in it; I do not glory of myself, but I glory in that which the
      Lord hath commanded me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the
      hands of God, to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my joy. And behold, when I see
      many of my brethren truly penitent, and coming to the Lord their God, then is my soul filled
      with joy; then do I remember what the Lord has done for me; yea, that he hath heard my prayer;
      yea, then do I remember his merciful arm which he extended towards me; yea, and I also
      remember the captivity of my fathers; for I surely do know that the Lord did deliver them out
      of bondage, and by this did establish his church; yea, the Lord God, the God of Abraham, the
      God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, did deliver them out of bondage; yea, I have always
      remembered the captivity of my fathers; and that same God who delivered them out of the hands
      of the Egyptians, did deliver them out of bondage; yea, and that same God did establish his
      church among them; yea, and that same God hath called me by a holy calling, to preach the word
      unto his people, and hath given me much success, in the which my joy is full; but I do not joy
      in my own success alone, but my joy is more full because of the success of my brethren, which
      have been up to the land of Nephi. Behold, they have labored exceedingly, and have brought
      forth much fruit; and how great shall be their reward. Now when I think of the success of
      these my brethren, my soul is carried away, even to the separation of it from the body, as it
      were, so great is my joy. And now may God grant unto these my brethren, that they may sit down
      in the kingdom of God; yea, and also all those which are the fruit of their labors, that they
      may go no more out, but that they may praise him forever. And may God grant that it may be
      done according to my words, even as I have spoken. Amen. </text>

    <text> Behold, now it came to pass that after the people of Ammon were established in the land
      of Jershon, yea, and also after the Lamanites were driven out of the land, and their dead were
      buried by the people of the land. Now their dead were not numbered, because of the greatness
      of their numbers; neither were the dead of the Nephites numbered. But it came to pass that
      after they had buried their dead, and also after the days of fasting, and mourning, and
      prayer, (and it was in the sixteenth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of
      Nephi,) there began to be continual peace throughout all the land; yea, and the people did
      observe to keep the commandments of the Lord; and they were strict in observing the ordinances
      of God, according to the law of Moses; for they were taught to keep the law of Moses, until it
      should be fulfilled; and thus the people did have no disturbance in all the sixteenth year of
      the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi. And it came to pass in the seventeenth year
      of the reign of the Judges, there was continual peace. But it came to pass in the latter end
      of the seventeenth year, there came a man into the land of Zarahemla; and he was Anti-Christ,
      for he began to preach unto the people against the prophecies which had been spoken by the
      prophets concerning the coming of Christ. Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it
      was strictly contrary to the commands of God, that there should be a law which should bring
      men on to unequal grounds. For thus saith the Scripture: Choose ye this day, whom ye will
      serve. Now if a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not
      believe in him, there was no law to punish him. But if he murdered, he was punished unto
      death; and if he robbed, he was also punished; and if he stole, he was also punished; and if
      he committed adultery, he was also punished; yea, for all this wickedness, they were punished:
      for there was a law, that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there
      was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he
      had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds. And this Anti- Christ, whose name was
      Korihor, and the law could have no hold upon him. And he began to preach unto the people, that
      there should be no Christ. And after this manner did he preach, saying: O ye that are bound
      down under a foolish and a vain hope, why do ye yoke yourselves with such foolish things? Why
      do ye look for a Christ? For no man can know of any thing which is to come. Behold, these
      things which ye call prophecies, which ye say are handed down by the holy prophets, behold,
      they are foolish traditions of your fathers. How do ye know of their surety? Behold, ye cannot
      know of things which ye do not see; therefore ye cannot know that there shall be a Christ. Ye
      look forward and say, that ye see a remission of your sins. But behold, it is the effects of a
      phrensied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the tradition of your
      fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so. And many more such
      things did he say unto them, telling them that there could be no atonement made for the sins
      of men, but every man fared in this life, according to the management of the creature;
      therefore every man prospered according to his genius, and that every man conquered according
      to his strength; and whatsoever a man did, was no crime. And thus he did preach unto them,
      leading away the hearts of many, causing them to lift up their heads in their wickedness; yea,
      leading away many women, and also men, to commit whoredoms; telling them that when a man was
      dead, that was the end thereof. Now this man went over to the land of Jershon, also, to preach
      these things among the people of Ammon, which were once the people of the Lamanites. But
      behold, they were more wise than many of the Nephites; for they took him, and bound him, and
      carried him before Ammon, which was a High Priest over that people. And it came to pass that
      he caused that he should be carried out of the land. And it came to pass that he came over
      into the land of Gideon, and began to preach unto them also; and here he did not have much
      success, for he was taken and bound, and carried before the High Priest, and also the Chief
      Judge over the land. And it came to pass that the High Priest saith unto him, Why do ye go
      about perverting the ways of the Lord? Why do ye teach this people that there shall be no
      Christ, to interrupt their rejoicings? Why do ye speak against all the prophecies of the holy
      prophets? Now the High Priest's name was Giddonah. And Korihor saith unto him, Because I do
      not teach the foolish traditions of your fathers, and because I do not teach this people to
      bind themselves down under the foolish ordinances and performances which are laid down by
      ancient priests, to usurp power and authority over them, to keep them in ignorance, that they
      may not lift up their heads, but be brought down according to thy words. Yea, say that this
      people is a free people. Behold, I say they are in bondage. Ye say that those ancient
      prophecies are true. Behold, I say that ye do not know that they are true. Ye say that this
      people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a parent. Behold, I
      say that a child is not guilty because of its parents. And ye also say that Christ shall come.
      But behold, I say that ye do not know that there shall be a Christ. And ye say also, that he
      shall be slain for the sins of the world; and thus ye lead away this people after the foolish
      traditions of your fathers, and according to your own desires; and ye keep them down, even as
      it were, in bondage that ye may glut yourselves with the labors of their hands, that they
      durst not look up with boldness, and that they durst not enjoy their rights and privileges;
      yea, they durst not make use of that which is there own, lest they should offend their
      priests, which do yoke them according to their desires, and hath brought them to believe by
      their traditions, and their dreams, and their whims, and their visions, and their pretended
      mysteries, that they should, if they did not do according to their words, offend some unknown
      being, which they say is God; a being which never hath been seen not known, which never was
      nor ever will be. Now when the High Priest and the Chief Judge saw the hardness of his heart;
      yea, when they saw that he would revile even against God, they would not make any reply to his
      words; but they caused that he should be bound; and they delivered him up into the hands of
      the officers, and sent him to the land of Zarahemla, that he might be brought before Alma, and
      the Chief Judge, which was governor over all the land. And it came to pass that when he was
      brought before Alma and the Chief Judge, that he did go on in the same manner as he did in the
      land of Gideon; yea, he went on to blaspheme. And he did rise up in great swelling words
      before Alma, and did revile against the priests and teachers, accusing them of leading away
      the people after the silly traditions of their fathers, for the sake of glutting in the labors
      of the people. --Now Alma saith unto him, Thou knowest that we do not glut ourselves upon the
      labors of this people; for behold, I have labored even from the commencement of the reign of
      Judges, until now, with mine own hands, for my support, notwithstanding my many travels round
      about the land, to declare the word of God unto my people. And notwithstanding the many labors
      which I have performed in the church, I have never received so much as even one senine for my
      labor; neither hath any of my brethren, save it were in the judgment seat; and then we have
      received only according to the law, for our time. And now if we do not receive any thing for
      our labors in the church, what doth it profit us to labor in the church, save it were to
      declare the truth, that we may have rejoicings in the joy of our brethren? Then why sayest
      thou that we preach unto this people to get gain, when thou thyself knowest that we receive no
      gain? And now, believest thou that we deceive this people, that causeth such joy in their
      hearts? --And Korihor answered him, Yea. And then Alma saith unto him, Believest thou that
      there is a God? And he answered, Nay, Now Alma saith unto him, If ye deny again that there is
      a God, and also deny the Christ: for behold, I say unto you, I know there is a God, and also
      that Christ shall come. And now, what evidence have ye that there is no God, or that Christ
      cometh not? I say unto you that ye have none, save it be your word only. But behold, I have
      all things as a testimony that these things are true; and ye also have all things as a
      testimony unto you that they are true; and will ye deny them? Believest thou that these things
      are true? Behold, I know that thou believest, but thou are possessed with a lying spirit, and
      ye have put off the spirit of God, that it may have no place in you; but the Devil hath power
      over you, and he doth carry you about, working devices, that he may destroy the children of
      God. And now Korihor saith unto Alma, If thou wilt shew me a sign, that I may be convinced
      that there is a God, yea, shew unto me that he hath power, and then I will be convinced of the
      truth of my words. But Alma saith unto him, Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your
      God? Will ye say, Shew unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of all these thy brethren,
      and also all the holy prophets? The Scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all things
      denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that is upon the face of it, yea,
      and its motion; yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form, doth witness
      that there is a Supreme Creator; and yet do ye go about, leading away the hearts of this
      people, testifying unto them there is no God. And yet will ye deny against all these
      witnesses? And he said, Yea, I will deny, except ye shall shew me a sign. And now it came to
      pass that Alma said unto him, Behold, I am grieved because of the hardness of your heart; yea,
      that ye will resist the spirit of the truth, that thy soul may be destroyed. But behold, it is
      better that thy soul should be lost, than that thou shouldst be the means of bringing many
      souls down to destructions, by thy lying and by thy flattering words; that thou shalt become
      dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people
      any more. Now Korihor saith unto him, I do not deny the existence of a God, but I do not
      believe that there is a God; and I say also, that ye do not know that there is a God; and
      except ye shew me a sign, I will not believe. Now Alma saith unto him, This will I give unto
      thee for a sign, that thou shalt be struck dumb, according to my words; and I say, that in the
      name of God, that ye shall be struck dumb, that ye shall no more have utterance. Now when Alma
      said these words, Korihor was struck dumb, that he could not have utterance, according to the
      words of Alma. And now when the Chief Judge saw this, he put forth his hand and wrote unto
      Korihor, saying: Art thou convinced of the power of a God? In whom did ye desire that Alma
      shew forth his sign? Would ye that he should afflict others, to shew unto thee a sign? Behold,
      he hath showed unto you a sign; and now, will ye dispute more? And Korihor put forth his hand,
      and wrote saying: I know that I am dumb, for I cannot speak; and I know that nothing, save it
      were the power of god could bring this upon me; yea, and I also knew that there was a God. But
      behold, the Devil hath deceived me; for he appeared unto me in the form of an angel, and said
      unto me, Go and reclaim this people, for they have all gone astray after an unknown God. And
      he saith unto me, There is no God; yea, and he taught me that which I should say. And I have
      taught his words; and I taught them, because they were pleasing unto the carnal mind; and I
      taught them, even until I had much success, insomuch that I verily believed that they were
      true; and for this cause, I withstood the truth, even until I have brought this great curse
      upon me. Now when he had said this, he besought that Alma should pray unto god, that the curse
      might be taken from him. But Alma said unto him, If this curse should be taken from thee thou
      wouldst again lead away the hearts of this people; therefore, it shall be unto thee, even as
      the Lord will. And it came to pass that the curse was not taken off of Korihor; but he was
      cast out, and went about from house to house, a begging for his food. Now the knowledge of
      what had happened unto Korihor, was immediately published throughout all the land; yea, the
      proclamation was sent forth by the Chief Judge, to all the people in the land, declaring to
      those who had believed in the words of Korihor, that they must speedily repent, lest the same
      judgments would come unto them. And it came to pass that they were all convinced of the
      wickedness of Korihor; therefore they were all converted again unto the Lord; and this put an
      end to the iniquity after the manner of Korihor. And Korihor did go about from house to house,
      a begging food for his support. And it came to pass that as he went forth among the people,
      yea, among a people which had separated themselves from the Nephites, and called themselves
      Zoramites, being led by a man whose name was Zoram; and as he went forth amongst them, behold,
      he was run upon, and trodden down, even until he was dead; and thus we see the end of him who
      perverteth the ways of the Lord; and thus we see that the Devil will not Support his children
      at the last day, but doth speedily drag them down to hell. </text>

    <text> Now it came to pass after the end of Korihor, Alma having received tidings that the
      Zoramites were perverting the ways of the Lord, and that Zoram, which was their leader, was
      leading the hearts of the people to bow down to dumb idols, &amp;c., his heart again began
      to sicken, because of the iniquity of the people; for it was the cause of great sorrow to
      Alma, to know of iniquity among his people; therefore his heart was exceeding sorrowful,
      because of the separation of the Zoramites from the Nephites. Now the Zoramites had gathered
      themselves together in a land which they called Antionum, which was east of the land of
      Zarahemla, which lay nearly bordering upon the seashore, which was south of the land of
      Jershon, which also bordered upon the wilderness south, which wilderness was full of the
      Lamanites. Now the Nephites greatly feared that the Zoramites would enter into a
      correspondence with the Lamanites, and that it would be the means of a great loss on the part
      of the Nephites. And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people
      to do that which was just; yea, it had had more power effect upon the minds of the people than
      the sword, or any thing else, which had happened unto them; therefore Alma thought it was
      expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God. Therefore he took Ammon, and
      Aaron, and Omner; and Himni he did leave in the church of Zarahemla; but the former three he
      took with him, and also Amulek and Zeesrom, which were at Melek; and he also took two of his
      sons. Now the eldest of his sons he took not with him; and his name was Helaman; but the names
      of those which he took with him, were Shiblon and Corianton: and these are the names of those
      which went with him among the Zoramites, to preach unto them the word. Now the Zoramites were
      dissenters from the Nephites; therefore they had the word of God preached unto them. But they
      had fell into great errors, for they would not observe to keep the commandments of God, and
      his statutes, according to the law of Moses; neither would they observe the performances of
      the church, to continue in prayer and supplication to God daily, that they might not enter
      into temptation; yea, in fine, they did pervert the ways of the Lord in very many instances;
      therefore, for this cause, Alma and his brethren went into the land, to preach the word unto
      them. Now when they had come into the land, behold, to their astonishment, they found that the
      Zoramites had built synagogues, and that they did gather themselves together on one day of the
      week, which they did call the day of the Lord; and they did worship after a manner which Alma
      and his brethren had never beheld; for they had a place built up in the centre of their
      synagogue, a place of standing, which was high above the head; and the top thereof would only
      admit one person. Therefore, whosoever desired to worship, must go forth and stand upon the
      top thereof, and stretch forth his hands towards heaven, and cry with a loud voice, saying:
      Holy, holy God; we believe that thou art God., and we believe that thou art holy, and that
      thou wast a spirit, and that thou art a spirit, and that thou wilt be a spirit forever. Holy
      God, we believe that thou hast separated us from our brethren; and we do not believe in the
      tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers;
      but we believe that thou hast elected us to be thy holy children; and also thou hast made it
      known unto us that there shall be no Christ; but thou art the same, yesterday, to-day, and
      forever; and thou hast elected us, that we shall be saved, whilst all around us are elected to
      be cast by thy wrath down to hell; for the which holiness, O God, we thank thee; and we also
      thank thee that thou hast elected us, that we may not be led away after the foolish traditions
      of our brethren, which doth bind them down to a belief of Christ, which doth lead their hearts
      to wander far from thee, our God. And again: We thank thee, O God, that we are a chosen and a
      holy people. Amen. Now it came to pass that after Alma and his brethren, and his sons, had
      heard these prayers, they were astonished beyond all measure. For behold, every man did go
      forth and offer up the same prayers. Now the place was called by them Rameumptom, which being
      interpreted is the Holy Stand. --Now from this stand, they did offer up, every man, the
      self-same prayer unto God, thanking their God that they were chosen of him, and that he did
      not lead them away after the tradition of their brethren; and that their hearts were not
      stolen away to believe in things to come, which they knew nothing about. Now after the people
      had all offered up thanks after this manner, they returned to their homes, never speaking of
      their God again, until they had assembled themselves together again, to the holy stand, to
      offer up thanks after their manner. Now when Alma saw this, his heart was grieved: for he saw
      that they were a wicked and a perverse people; yea, he saw that their hearts were set upon
      gold, and upon silver, and upon all manner of fine goods. Yea, and he also saw that their
      hearts were lifted up into great boasting, in their pride. And he lifted up his voice to
      Heaven, and cried, saying: O how long O Lord, wilt thou suffer that thy servants shall dwell
      here below in the flesh, to behold such gross wickedness among the children of men. Behold, O
      God, they cry unto thee, and yet their hearts are swallowed up in their pride. Behold, O God,
      they cry unto thee with their mouths, while they are puffed up, even to greatness, with the
      vain things of the world. Behold, O my God, their costly apparel, and their ringlets, and
      their bracelets, and their ornaments of gold, and all their precious things which they are
      ornamented with; and behold, their hearts are set upon them, and yet they cry unto thee and
      say, We thank thee, O God, for we are a chosen people unto thee, while others shall perish.
      Yea, and they say that thou hast made it known unto them, that there shall be no Christ. O
      Lord God, how long wilt thou suffer that such wickedness and iniquity shall be among this
      people? O Lord, wilt thou give me strength, that I may bear with mine infirmities? for I am
      infirm, and such wickedness among this people doth pain my soul. O Lord, my heart is exceeding
      sorrowful; wilt thou comfort my soul in Christ? O Lord, wilt thou grant unto me that I may
      have strength, that I may suffer with patience these afflictions which shall come upon me,
      because of the iniquity of this people? O Lord, wilt thou comfort my soul, and give unto me
      success, and also my fellow-laborers which are with me; yea, Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and
      also Amulek, and Zeezrom, and also my two sons; yea, even all these wilt thou comfort, O Lord?
      Yea, wilt thou comfort their souls in Christ? Wilt thou grant unto them that they may have
      strength, that they may bear their afflictions which shall come upon them, because of the
      iniquities of this people? O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in
      bringing them again unto thee, in Christ? Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious, and many
      of them are our near brethren, therefore, give unto us O Lord, power and wisdom, that we may
      bring these, our brethren, again unto thee. Now it came to pass, that when Alma had said these
      words, that he clapped his hands upon all they which were with him. And behold, as he clapped
      his hands upon them, they were filled with the holy Spirit. And after that, they did separate
      themselves one from another, taking no thoughts for themselves what they should eat, or what
      they should drink, or what they should put on. And the Lord provided for them that they should
      hunger not, neither should they thirst; yea, and he also gave them strength, that they should
      suffer no manner of afflictions, save it were swallowed up in the joy of Christ. --Now this
      was according to the prayer of Alma; and this because he prayed in faith. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that they did go forth, and began to preach the word of God unto the
      people, entering into their synagogues, and into their houses; yea, and even they did preach
      the word in their streets. And it came to pass that after much labor among them, they began to
      have success among the poor class of people; for behold, they were cast out of the synagogues,
      because of the coarseness of their apparel; therefore they were not permitted to enter into
      their synagogues to worship God, being esteemed as filthiness; therefore they were poor; yea,
      they were esteemed by their brethren as dross; therefore they were poor as to things of the
      world; and also they were poor in heart. Now as Alma was teaching and speaking unto the people
      upon the hill Onidah, there came a great multitude unto him, which were those of which we have
      been speaking, of which were poor in heart, because of their poverty as to the things of the
      world. And they came unto Alma; and the one which was the most foremost among them, saith unto
      him, Behold, what shall these my brethren do, for they are despised of all men, because of
      their poverty; yea, and more especially by our priests; for they have cast us out of our
      synagogues, which we have labored abundantly to build, with our own hands; and they have cast
      us out because of this our exceeding poverty, that we have no place to worship God; and
      behold, what shall we do? And now when Alma heard this, he turned him about, his face
      immediately towards him, and he beheld, with great joy; for he beheld that their afflictions
      had truly humbled them, and that they were in a preparation to hear the word; therefore he did
      say no more to the other multitude, but he stretched forth his hand, and cried unto those
      which he beheld, which were truly penitent, and saith unto them, I beheld that ye are lowly in
      heart; and if so, blessed are ye. Behold, thy brother hath said, What shall we do? for we are
      cast out of our synagogues, that we cannot worship God. Behold I say unto you, Do ye suppose
      that ye cannot worship God, save it be in your synagogues? And moreover, I would ask, Do ye
      suppose that ye must not worship God only once in a week? I say unto you, It is well that ye
      are cast out of your synagogues, that ye may be humbled, and that ye may learn wisdom; for it
      is necessary that ye should learn wisdom; for it is because ye are cast out, that ye are
      despised of your brethren; because of your exceeding poverty, that ye are brought to a
      lowliness of heart; for ye are necessarily brought to be humble, blessed are ye; for a man
      sometimes, if he is compelled to be humble, seeketh repentance; and now surely, whosoever
      repenteth, shall find mercy; and he that findeth mercy and endureth to the end, the same shall
      be saved. And now as I said unto you, That because ye are compelled to be humble, ye were
      blessed, do ye suppose that they are more blessed who truly humble themselves because of the
      word? Yea, he that truly humbleth himself, and repenteth of his sin, and endureth to the end,
      the same shall be blessed; yea, much more blessed than they who art compelled to be humble,
      because of their exceeding poverty; therefore blessed are they who humbleth themselves without
      being compelled to be humble; or rather, in other words, blessed is he that believeth in the
      word of God, and is baptized without stubborness of heart; yea, without being brought to know
      the word, or even compelled to know, before they will believe. Yea, there are many which do
      say, If thou wilt show unto us a sign from Heaven, then we shall know of a surety; then we
      shall believe. Now I ask, Is this faith? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for if a man knoweth a
      thing, he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it. And now, how much more cursed is he
      that only believeth, or only hath cause to believe, and falleth into transgression? Now of
      this thing, ye must judge. Behold, I say unto you, That it is on the one hand, even as it is
      on the other; and it shall be unto every man according to his work. And now as I said
      concerning faith: Faith, is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have
      faith, ye hope for things which is not seen, which are true. And now, behold, I say unto you:
      and I would that ye should remember that God is merciful unto all who believe on his name;
      therefore he desireth, in the first place, that ye should believe, yea, even on his word. And
      now, he imparteth his word by angels, unto men; yea, not only men, but women also. Now this is
      not all: little children doth have words given unto them many times, which doth confound the
      wise and learned. And now. my beloved brethren, as ye have desired to know of me what shall ye
      do because ye are afflicted and cast out: now I do not desire that ye should suppose that I
      mean to judge you only according to that which is true; for I do not mean that ye all of you
      have been compelled to humble yourselves;. for I verily believe there are some among you which
      would humble themselves, let them be in whatsoever circumstances they might. Now as I said
      concerning faith --that it was not a perfect knowledge, even so it is with my words. Ye cannot
      know of their surety at first, unto perfection, any more than faith is a perfect knowledge.
      But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words,
      and exercise a particle of faith; yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this
      desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of
      my words. Now we will compare the word unto a seed. Now if ye give place, that a seed may be
      planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye cast it out by your
      unbelief, that ye will resist the spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within
      your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within
      yourselves, It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it
      beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding; yea, and it
      beginneth to be delicious to me. Now behold, would not this increase your faith? I say unto
      you, yea; nevertheless it hath not grown up to a perfect knowledge. But behold, as the seed
      swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, and then ye must needs say, That the seed is
      good; for behold it swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow. And now behold, are ye
      sure that this is a good seed? I say unto you, Yea; for every seed bringeth forth unto its own
      likeness; therefore. if a seed groweth, it is good, but if it groweth not, behold, it is not
      good; therefore it is cast away. And now behold, because ye have tried the experiment, and
      planted the seed, and it swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, ye must needs know
      that the seed is good. And now behold, is your knowledge perfect? Yea, your knowledge is
      perfect in that thing. and your faith is dormant; and this because you know; for ye know that
      the word hath swelled your souls; and ye also know that it hath sprouted up, that your
      understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and your mind doth begin to expand. O then, is not
      this real? I say unto you, yea, because it is light; and whatsoever is light, is good, because
      it is discernible; therefore ye must know that it is good. And now behold, after ye have
      tasted this light, is your knowledge perfect? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; neither must ye lay
      aside your faith, for ye have only exercised your faith to plant the seed, that ye might try
      the experiment, to know if the seed was good. And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye
      will say, Let us nourish it with great care, that ii may get root, that it may grow up and
      bring forth fruit unto us. And now behold, if ye nourish it with much care, it will get root,
      and grow up, and bring forth fruit. But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its
      nourishment, behold, it will not get any root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and
      scorcheth it, and because it hath no root, it whithereth away, and ye pluck it up and cast it
      out. Now this is not because the seed was not good; neither is it because the fruit thereof
      would not be desirable. But it is because your ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the
      tree; therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof. And thus if ye will not nourish the word,
      looking forward with an eye of faith to the fruit thereof, ye can never pluck of the fruit of
      the tree of life. But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth to
      grow, by your faith, with great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit
      thereof, and it shall take root; and behold, it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting
      life; and because of your diligence, and your faith, and your patience with the word, in
      nourishing it, that it may take root in you, behold, by and by, ye shall pluck the fruit
      thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet, and which is white
      above all that is white; yea, and pure above all that is pure; and ye shall feast upon this
      fruit, even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst. Then my brethren
      ye shall reap the rewards of your faith, and your diligence, and patience, and long suffering,
      waiting for the tree to bring forth fruit unto you. </text>

    <text> Now after Alma had spoken these words, they sent forth unto him desiring to know whether
      they should believe in one God, that they might obtain this fruit of which he had spoken, or
      how they should plant the seed, or the word, of which he had spoken, which he said must be
      planted in their hearts; or in what manner they should begin to exercise their faith. And Alma
      said unto them, Behold, ye have said that ye could not worship your God, because ye are cast
      out of your synagogues. But behold, I say unto you, If ye suppose that ye cannot worship God,
      ye do greatly err, and ye had ought to search the Scriptures; for if ye suppose that they have
      taught you this, ye do not understand them. Do ye remember to have read what Zenos, the
      prophet of old, hath said concerning prayer or worship? for he saith, Thou art merciful O God,
      for thou hast heard my prayer, even when I was in the wilderness; yea, thou wast merciful when
      I prayed concerning those which were mine enemies, and thou didst turn them to me; yea, O God,
      and thou wast merciful unto me when I did cry unto thee in my field; when I did cry unto thee
      in my prayer, and thou didst hear me. And again, O God, when I did turn to my house thou didst
      hear me in my prayer, And when I did turn unto my closet, O Lord, and prayed unto thee, thou
      didst hear me; yea, thou art merciful unto thy children, when they cry unto to thee to be
      heard of thee, and not of men; and thou wilt hear them; yea, O God, thou hast been merciful
      unto me, and heard my cries in the midst of thy congregations; yea, and thou hast also heard
      me when I have been cast out, and have been despised by mine enemies; yea, thou didst hear my
      cries, and wast angry with mine enemies, and thou didst visit them in thine anger, with speedy
      destruction; and thou didst hear me because of mine afflictions and my sincerity; and it is
      because of thy Son that hast been thus merciful unto me; therefore I will cry unto thee in all
      mine afflictions; for in thee is my joy; for thou hast turned they judgments away from me,
      because of thy Son. And now Alma saith unto them, Do ye believe those Scriptures which have
      been written by them of old? Behold, if ye do, ye must believe what Zenos saith; for behold,
      he saith, Thou hast turned away thy judgments, because of thy Son. --Now behold, my brethren,
      I would ask, if ye have read the Scriptures? If ye have, how can ye disbelieve on the Son of
      God? For it is not written that Zenos alone spake of these things; for behold, he saith, Thou
      art angry, O Lord, with this people, because they will not understand of thy mercies which
      thou hast bestowed upon them, because of they Son. And now my brethren, ye see that a second
      prophet of old has testified of the Son of God; and because the people would not understand
      his words, they stoned him to death. But behold, this is not all; these are not the only ones
      which have spoken concerning the Son of God. Behold, he was spoken of by Moses; yea, and
      behold, a type was raised up in the wilderness, that whosoever would look upon it might live.
      And many did look and live. But few understood the meaning of those things, and this because
      of the hardness of their hearts. But there were many which were so hardened that they would
      not look; therefore they perished. Now the reason that they would not look, is because they
      did not believe that it would heal them. O my brethren, if ye could be healed by merely
      casting about your eyes, that ye might be healed, would ye not behold quickly, or would ye
      rather harden your hearts in unbelief, and be slothful, that ye would not cast about your
      eyes, that ye might perish? If so, wo shall come upon you; but if not so, then cast about your
      eyes, and begin to believe in the Son of God, that he will come to redeem his people, and that
      he shall suffer and die to atone for their sins; and that he shall rise again from the dead,
      which shall bring to pass the resurrection, that all men shall stand before him, to be judged,
      at the last and judgment day, according to their works. And now my brethren, I desire that ye
      should plant this word in your hearts, and as it beginneth to swell, even so nourish it by
      your faith. And behold, it will become a tree, springing up in you unto everlasting life. And
      then may God grant unto you that your burdens may be light, through the joy of his Son. And
      even all this can ye do, if ye will. Amen. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that after Alma had spoken these words unto them, he sat down
      upon the ground, and Amulek arose and began to teach them, saying: My brethren, I think that
      it is impossible that ye should be ignorant of the things which have been spoken concerning
      the coming of Christ, who is taught by us to be the Son of God; yea, I know that these things
      were taught unto you, bountifully, before your dissention from among us. And as ye have
      desired of my beloved brother, that he should make known unto you what ye should do, because
      of your afflictions; and he hath spoken somewhat unto you to prepare your minds; yea, and he
      hath exhorted you unto faith, and to patience; yea, even that ye would have so much faith as
      even to plant the word in your hearts, that ye may try the experiment of its goodness; and we
      have beheld that the great question which is in your minds, is whether the word be in the Son
      of God, or whether there shall be no Christ. And ye also beheld that my brother hath proven
      unto you, in many instances, that the word is in Christ, unto salvation. My brother hath
      called upon the words of Zenos, that redemption cometh through the Son of God, and also upon
      the words of Zenock; and also he hath appealed unto Moses, to prove these things are true. And
      now behold, I will testify unto you of myself, that these things are true. --Behold, I say
      unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him
      the transgressions of his people, and that he shall atone for the sins of the world; for the
      Lord God hath spoken it; for it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according
      to the great plan of the Eternal God, there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind
      must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are fallen, and are lost, and must
      perish, except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made; for it is
      expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man,
      neither beast, neither of any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it
      must be an Infinite and an Eternal sacrifice. Now there is not any man that can sacrifice his
      own blood, which will atone for the sins of another. Now if a man murdereth, behold, will our
      law, which is just, take the life of his brother? I say unto you Nay. But the law requireth
      the life of him who hath murdered; therefore there can nothing, which is short of an Infinite
      atonement, which will suffice for the sins of the world; therefore it is expedient that there
      should be a great and last sacrifice; and then shall there be, or it expedient there should be
      a stop to the shedding of blood; then shall the law of Moses be fulfilled; yea, it shall all
      be fulfilled; every jot and tittle, and none shall have passed away. And behold, this is the
      whole meaning of the law; every whit a pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that
      great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God; yea, Infinite and Eternal; and thus he shall
      bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last
      sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice and bringeth about
      means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance. And thus mercy can satisfy the
      demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety, while he that exerciseth no
      faith unto repentance, is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice; therefore, only
      unto him that hath faith unto repentance, is brought about the great and Eternal plan of
      redemption; therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye might begin to exercise
      your faith unto repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name, that he would have mercy
      upon you; yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty to save; yea, humble yourselves, and
      continue in prayer unto him; cry unto him when ye are in your fields; yea, over all your
      flocks; cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both morning, mid-day, and
      evening; yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies; yea, cry unto him against the
      Devil, which is an enemy to all righteousness. Cry unto him over the crops of your fields,
      that ye may prosper in them; cry over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase. But
      this is not all: ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in
      your wilderness; yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn
      out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those which
      are around you. And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, Do not suppose that this
      is all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and
      visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand
      in need; I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold, your prayer is vain, and
      availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites which do deny the faith; therefore, if ye do
      not remember to be charitable, ye are as dross, which the refiners do cast out, (it being of
      no worth,) and is trodden under foot of men. And now, my brethren, I would that after ye have
      received so many witnesses, seeing that the Holy Scriptures testify of these things, come
      forth and bring fruit unto repentance; yea, I would that ye would come forth and harden not
      your hearts any longer; for behold, now is the time, and the day of your salvation; and
      therefore, if ye will repent and harden not your hearts, immediately shall the great plan of
      redemption be brought about unto you. For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to
      meet God; yea, behold, the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors. And
      now as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many witnesses, therefore I beseech of you,
      that ye not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end; for after this day of
      life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while
      in this life, then cometh the night of darkness, wherein there can be no labor performed. Ye
      cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will return
      to God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the
      time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in
      that eternal world. For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance, even
      until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the Devil, and he doth seal you
      his; therefore the spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and
      the Devil hath all power over you: and this is the final state of the wicked. And this I know,
      because the Lord hath said, he dwelleth not in unholy temples, but in the hearts of the
      righteous doth he dwell; yea, and he hath also said, that the righteous should sit down in his
      kingdom, to go no more out; but their garments should be made white, through the blood of the
      Lamb. And now my beloved brethren, I desire that ye should remember these things, and that ye
      should work out your salvation with fear before God, and that ye should no more deny the
      coming of Christ; that ye contend no more against the Holy Ghost, but that ye receive it, and
      take upon you the name of Christ; that ye humble yourselves even to the dust, and worship God
      in whatsoever place ye may be in, in spirit and in truth; and that ye live in thanksgiving
      daily, for the many mercies and blessings which he doth bestow upon you; yea, and I also
      exhort you my brethren, that ye be watchful unto prayer continually, that ye may not be led
      away by the temptation of the Devil, that he may not overpower you, that ye not become his
      subjects at the last day: for behold, he rewardeth you no good thing. And now my beloved
      brethren, I would exhort you to have patience, and that ye bear with all manner of
      afflictions; that ye do not revile against those who cast you out because of your exceeding
      poverty, lest ye become sinners like unto them; but that ye have patience, and bear with those
      afflictions, with a firm hope that ye shall one day rest from all your afflictions. </text>

    <text> Now it came to pass that after Amulek had made an end of these words, they withdrew
      themselves from the multitude, and came over into the land of Jershon; yea, and the rest of
      the brethren, after they had preached the word unto the Zoramites, also came over into the
      land of Jershon. And it came to pass that after the more popular part of the Zoramites had
      consulted together, concerning the words which had been preached unto them, they were angry
      because of the word, for it did destroy their craft; therefore they would not hearken unto the
      words. And they sent and gathered together throughout all the land, all the people, and
      consulted with them concerning the words which had been spoken. Now their rulers, and their
      priests, and their teachers, did not let the people know concerning their desires; therefore
      therefore they found out privily the minds of all the people. And it came to pass that after
      they found out the minds of all the people, those which were in favor of the words which had
      been spoken by Alma and his brethren, were cast out of the land; and they were many; and they
      came over also into the land of Jershon. And it came to pass that Alma and his brethren did
      minister unto them. Now the people of the Zoramites were angry with the people of Ammon which
      were in Jershon, and the chief ruler of the Zoramites being a very wicked man, sent over unto
      the people of Ammon desiring them that they should cast out of their land all those which came
      over from them into their land. And he breathed out many threatnings against them. And now the
      people of Ammon did not fear their words, therefore they did cast them out, but they did
      receive all the poor of the Zoramites that came over unto them; and they did nourish them, and
      did clothe them, and did give unto them lands for their inheritance; and they did administer
      unto them according to their wants. Now this did stir up the Zoramites to anger against the
      people of Ammon, and they began to mix with the Lamanites, and to stir them up also to anger
      against them; and thus the Zoramites and the Lamanites began to make preparations for the war
      against the people of Ammon, and also against the Nephites. And thus ended the seventeenth
      year of the reign of Judges, over the people of Nephi. And the people of Ammon departed out of
      the land of Jershon, and came over into the land of Melek, and gave place in the land of
      Jershon for the armies of the Nephites, that they might contend with the armies of the
      Lamanites, and the armies of the Zoramites; and thus commenced a war betwixt the Lamanites and
      the Nephites, in the eighteenth year of the reign of the Judges; and an account shall be given
      of their wars hereafter. And Alma, and Ammon, and their brethren and also the two sons of
      Alma, returned to the land of Zarahemla, after having been instruments in the hands of God of
      bringing many of the Zoramites to repentance, were driven out of their land; but they have
      lands for their inheritance in the land of Jershon, and they have taken up arms to defend
      themselves, and their wives, and their children, and their lands. Now Alma, being grieved for
      the iniquity of his people, yea, for the wars, and the bloodsheds, and the contentions which
      were amog them; and having to declare the word, or sent to declare the word, among all the
      people in every city; and seeing that the hearts of the people began to wax hard, and that
      they began to be offended because of the strictness of the word, his heart was exceeding
      sorrowful; therefore, he caused that his sons should be gathered together, that he might give
      unto them every one his charge, separately, concerning the things pertaining unto
      righteousness. And we have an account of his commandments, which he gave unto them according
      to his own record. </text>

    <text> My son, give ear to my words; for I swear unto you, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the
      commandments of God, ye shall prosper in the land. I would that ye should do as I have done,
      in remembering the captivity of our fathers; for they were in bondage, and none could deliver
      them, except it was the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and he
      surely did deliver them in their afflictions. --And now, O my son Helaman, behold, thou art in
      thy youth, and therefore I beseech of thee that thou wilt hear my words. and learn of me; for
      I do not know that whomsoever shall put his trust in God, shall be supported in their trials,
      and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day; and I would
      not that ye think that I know of myself, not of the temporal, but of the spiritual; not of the
      carnal mind, but of God. Now behold I say unto you, If I had not been born of God, I should
      not have known these things; but God hath, by the mouth of his holy angel, made these things
      known unto me, not of any worthiness of myself, for I went about with the sons of Mosiah,
      seeking to destroy the church of God; but behold, God sent his holy angel to stop us by the
      way. --And behold, he spake unto us, as it were the voice of thunder, and the whole earth did
      tremble beneath our feet, and we all fell to the earth, for the fear of the Lord came upon us.
      But behold, the voice said unto me, Arise. And I arose and stood up, and beheld the angel. And
      he said unto me, if thou wilt of thyself be destroyed, seek no more to destroy the church of
      God. And it came to pass that I fell to the earth; and it was for the space of three days and
      three nights, that I could not open my mouth; neither had I the use of my limbs. And the angel
      spake more things unto me, which were heard by my brethren, but I did not hear them; for when
      I heard the words, If thou wilt be destroyed of thyself, seek no more to destroy the church of
      God, I was struck with such great fear and amazement, lest perhaps that I should be destroyed,
      that I fell to the earth, and I did hear no more; but I was racked with eternal torment, for
      my soul was harrowed up to the greatest degree, and racked with all my sins. Yea, I did
      remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was tormented with the pains of hell; yea, I
      saw that I had rebelled against my God, and that I had not kept his holy commandments; yea,
      and I had murdered many of his children, or rather led them away unto destruction; yea, and in
      fine, so great had been my iniquities, that the very thoughts of coming into the presence of
      my God, did rack my soul with inexpressible horror. O, thought I, that I could be banished and
      become extinct both soul and body, that I might not be brought to stand in the presence of my
      God, to be judged of my deeds. And now, for three days and for three nights was I racked, even
      with the pains of a damned soul. And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment
      while I harrowed up by the memory of my many sins behold, I remembered also to have heard my
      father prophecy unto the people, concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to
      atone for the sins of the world. Now as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within
      my heart, O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who art in the gall of bitterness, and
      art encircled about by the everlasting chains of death. And now behold, when I thought this, I
      could remember my pains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more. And
      O, what joy, and what marvellous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as
      exceeding as was my pain; yea, I say unto you, my son. that there could be nothing so
      exquisite and so bitter, as was my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the
      other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy; yea, and methought I
      saw even as our father Lehi saw, God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless
      concourses of angels, in the attitude of singing and praising their God; yea, and my soul did
      long to be there. But behold, my limbs did receive their strength again, and I stood upon my
      feet, and did manifest unto the people that I had been born of God; yea, and from that time,
      even until now, I have labored without ceasing, that I might bring souls unto repentance; that
      I might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which I did taste; that they might also be
      born of God, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. Yea, and now behold, O my son, the Lord doth
      give me exceeding great joy in the fruit of my labors; for because of the word which he hath
      imparted unto me, behold, many hath been born of God, and hath tasted as I have tasted, and
      hath seen eye to eye, as I have seen; therefore they do know of these things of which I have
      spoken, as I do know; and the knowledge which I have is of God. And I have been supported
      under trials and troubles of every kind, yea, and in all manner of afflictions; yea, God hath
      delivered me from prison, and from bonds, and from death; yea, and I do put my trust in him,
      and he will still deliver me; and I know that he will raise me up at the last day, to dwell
      with him in glory; yea, and I will praise him forever, for he hath brought our fathers out of
      Egypt, and he hath swallowed up the Egyptians in the red sea; and he led them by his power
      into the promised land; yea, and he hath delivered them out of bondage and captivity, from
      time to time; yea, and he hath also brought our fathers out of Jerusalem; and he hath also, by
      his everlasting power, delivered them out of bondage and captivity, from time to time, even
      down to the present day; and I have always retained in remembrance their captivity; yea, and
      ye also had ought to retain in remembrance, as I have done, their captivity. --But behold, my
      son, this is not all: for ye had ought to know, as I do know, that inasmuch as ye shall keep
      the commandments of God, ye shall prosper in the land; and ye had ought to know also, that
      inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God, ye shall be cut off from his presence.

    <text> And now my son Helaman, I command you that ye take the records which have been entrusted
      with me; and I also command you that ye shall keep a record of this people, according as I
      have done, upon the plates of Nephi, and keep all these things sacred which I have kept, even
      as I kept them: for it is for a wise purpose that they are kept; and these plates of brass
      which contain these engravings, which have the records of the Holy Scriptures upon them, which
      have the genealogy of our forefathers, even from the beginning. And behold, it hath been
      prophesied by our fathers, that they should be kept and handed down from one generation to
      another, and be kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord, until they should go forth unto
      every nation, kindred, tongue and people, that they shall know of the mysteries contained
      thereon. And now behold, if they are kept, they must retain their brightness; yea, and they
      will retain their brightness; yea, and also shall all the plates which do contain that which
      is Holy Writ. Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you,
      That by small and simple things, are great things brought to pass; and small means, in many
      instances, doth confound the wise. And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his
      great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise, and
      bringeth about salvation of many souls. And now, it hath hitherto been wisdom in God, that
      these things should be preserved: for behold, they have enlarged the memory of this people,
      yea, and convinced many of the error of their ways, and brought them to the knowledge of their
      God, unto the salvation of their souls. Yea, I say unto you, were it not for these things that
      these records do contain, which are on these plates, Ammon and his brethren could not have
      convinced so many thousand of the Lamanites, of the incorrect tradition of their fathers; yea,
      these records and their words, brought them unto repentance; that is, they brought them to the
      knowledge of the Lord their God, and to rejoice in Jesus Christ, their Redeemer. And who
      knoweth but what they will be the means of bringing many thousands of them, yea, and also many
      thousands of our stiffnecked brethren, the Nephites, which are now hardening their hearts in
      sin and iniquities, to the knowledge of their Redeemer? --Now these mysteries are not yet
      fully made known unto me; therefore I shall forebear. And it may suffice, if I only say, they
      are preserved for a wise purpose, which purpose is known unto God: for he doth counsel in
      wisdom over all his works, and his paths are straight, and his course is one eternal round. O
      remember, remember, my son Helaman, how strict are the commandments of God. And he saith, if
      ye will keep my commandments, ye shall prosper in the land; but if ye keep not his
      commandments, ye shall be cut off from his presence. And now remember, my son, that God hath
      entrusted you with these things, which are sacred, which he hath kept sacred, and also which
      he will keep and preserve for a wise purpose in him, that he may shew forth his power unto
      future generations. And now behold, I tell you by the spirit of prophecy, that if ye
      transgress the commandments of God, behold, these things which are sacred, shall be taken away
      from you by the power of God, and ye shall be delivered up unto Satan, that he may sift you as
      chaff before the wind; but if ye keep the commandments of God, and do with these things which
      are sacred, according to that which the Lord doth command you, (for you must appeal unto the
      Lord for all things whatsoever ye must do with them,) behold, no power of earth or hell can
      take them from you, for God is powerful to the fulfilling of all his words: for he will
      fulfill all his promises which he shall make unto you, for he hath fulfilled his promise which
      he hath made unto our fathers. For he promised unto them that he would reserve these things
      for a wise purpose in him, that he might shew forth his power unto future generations. And now
      behold, one purpose hath he fulfilled, even to the restoration of many thousands of the
      Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth; and he has shewn forth his power in them, and he will
      also still shew forth his power in them, unto future generations; therefore they shall be
      preserved; therefore I command you, my son Helaman, that ye be diligent in fulfilling all my
      words, and that ye be diligent in keeping the commandments of God, as they are written. And
      now, I will speak unto you concerning those twentyfour plates, that ye keep them, that the
      mysteries and the works of darkness, and their secret works, or the secret works of those
      people, which have been destroyed, may be made manifest unto this people; yea, all their
      murders, and robbings, and their plunderings, and all their wickedness, and abominations, may
      be made manifest unto this people; yea, and that ye preserve these directors. For behold; the
      Lord saw that his people began to work in darkness, yea, work secret murders and abominations;
      therefore the Lord said, If they did not repent, they should be destroyed from off the face of
      the earth. And the Lord said, I will prepare unto my servant Gazelem, a stone, which shall
      shine forth in darkness unto light, that I may discover unto my people which serve me, that I
      may discover unto them the works of their brethren; yea, their secret works, their works of
      darkness, and their wickedness and abominations. And now my son, these directors were
      prepared, that the word of God might be fulfilled, which he spake saying: I will bring forth
      out of darkness unto light, all their secret works and their abominations; and except they
      repent, I will destroy them from off the face of the earth; and I will bring to light all
      their secrets and abominations, unto every nation that shall hereafter possess the land. And
      now my son, we see that they did not repent; therefore they have been destroyed, and thus far
      the word of God hath been fulfilled; yea, their secret abominations have been brought out of
      darkness, and made known unto us. And now my son, I command you that ye retain all their
      oaths, and their covenants, and their agreements in their secret abominations; yea, and all
      their sign and their wonders ye shall retain from this people, that they know them not, lest
      peradventure they should fall into darkness also, and be destroyed. For behold, there is a
      curse upon all this land, that destruction shall come upon all those workers of darkness,
      according to the power of God, when they are fully ripe; therefore I desire that this people
      might not be destroyed, --Therefore, ye shall keep these secret plans of their oaths and their
      covenants from this people, and only their wickedness, and their murders, and their
      abominations, shall ye make known unto them; and ye shall teach them to abhor such wickedness,
      and abominations, murders; and ye shall also teach them, that these people were destroyed on
      account of their wickedness, and abominations, and their murders. For behold, they murdered
      all the prophets of the Lord which came among them, to declare unto them concerning their
      iniquities; and the blood of those which they murdered, did cry unto the Lord their God, for
      vengeance upon those which were their murderers; and thus the judgments of God did come upon
      these workers of darkness and secret combinations; yea, and cursed be the land forever and
      ever unto those workers of darkness and secret combinations, even unto destruction, except
      they repent before they are fully ripe. And now my son, remember the words which I have spoken
      unto you: trust not those secret plans unto this people, but teach them an everlasting hatred
      against sin and iniquity; preach unto them repentance, and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ;
      teach them to humble themselves, and to be meek and lowly in heart; teach them to withstand
      every temptation of the Devil, with their faith on the Lord Jesus Christ; teach them to never
      be weary of good works, but to be meek and lowly in heart: for such shall find rest to their
      souls. O remember my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the
      commandments of god; yea, and cry unto God for all thy support; yea, let all thy doings be
      unto the Lord, and whithersoever thou goest, let it be in the Lord; yea, thy thought be
      directed unto the Lord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever;
      counsel the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee good; yea, when thou liest down at
      night, lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest
      in the morning, let thy heart be full of thanks unto god; and if ye do these things, ye shall
      be lifted up at the last day. And now my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the thing
      which our fathers call a ball, or director; our fathers called it liahona, which is
      interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it. And behold, there cannot any man work after
      the manner of so curious a workmanship. And behold, it was prepared to shew unto our fathers
      the course which they should travel in the wilderness; and it did work for them according to
      their faith in God; therefore if they had faith to believe that God could cause that those
      spindles should point the way they should go, behold, it was done; therefore they had this
      miracle, and also many other miracles wrought by the power of God, day by day; nevertheless,
      because those miracles were worked by small means, nevertheless it did shew unto them
      marvellous works. They were slothful, and forgot to exercise their faith and diligence, and
      those marvellous works ceased, and they did not progress in their journey; therefore they
      tarried in the wilderness, or did not travel a direct course, and were afflicted with hunger
      and thirst, because of their transgressions. And now my son, I would that ye should understand
      that these things are not without a shadow; for as our fathers were slothful to give heed to
      this compass, (now these things were temporal,) they did not prosper; even so it is with
      things which are spiritual. For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ,
      which will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give
      heed to this compass, which would point unto the a straight course to the promised land. And
      now I say, Is there not a type in this thing? For just as suredly as this director did bring
      our fathers, by following its course, to the promised land, shall the words of Christ, if we
      follow its course, carry us beyond this vale of sorrow, into a far better land of promise. O
      my son, do not let us be slothful, because of the easiness of the way; for so was it with our
      fathers; for so was it prepared for them, that if they would look, they might live; even so it
      is with us. The way is prepared, and if we will look, we may live forever. And now my son, see
      that ye take care of these sacred things; yea, see that ye look to God and live. Go unto this
      people, and declare the word, and be sober, --My son, farewell. </text>

    <text> My son, give ear to my words: for I say unto you, even as I said unto Helaman, That
      inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God, ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch
      as ye will not keep the commandments of God, ye shall be cast off from his presence. And now
      my son, I trust that I shall have great joy in you, because of your steadiness and your
      faithfulness unto God; for as you have commenced in your youth, to look to the Lord your God,
      even so I hope that you will continue in keeping his commandments: for blessed is he that
      endureth to the end. I say unto you my son, that I have had great joy in thee already, because
      of thy faithfulness, and thy diligence, and thy patience, and thy long suffering among the
      people of the Zoramites. For I knew that thou wast in bonds; yea, and I also knew that thou
      wast stoned for the word's sake; and thou didst bear all these things with patience, because
      the Lord was with thee: and now thou knowest that the Lord did deliver thee. And now my son,
      Shiblon, I would that ye should remember that as much as ye shall put your trust in God, even
      so much ye shall be delivered out of your trials, and your troubles, and your afflictions ;
      and ye shall be lifted up at the last day. Now my son, I would not that ye should think that I
      know these things of myself, but it is the spirit of God which is in me, which maketh these
      things known unto me: for if I had not been born of God, I should not have known these things.
      But behold, the Lord in his great mercy sent his angel to declare unto me, that I must stop
      the work of destruction among his people; yea, and I have seen an angel face to face; and he
      spake with me, and his voice was as thunder, and it shook the whole earth. And it came to pass
      that I was three days and three nights in the most bitter pain and anguish of soul; and never,
      until I did cry unto the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, did I receive a remission of my sins.
      But behold, I did cry unto him, and I did find peace to my soul. And now my son, I have told
      you this, that ye may learn wisdom, that ye may learn of me that there is no other way or
      means whereby man can be saved, only in and through Christ. Behold, he is the life and the
      light of the world. Behold, he is the word of truth and righteousness. And now, as ye have
      begun to teach the word, even so I would that ye should continue to teach; and I would that ye
      would be diligent and temperate in all things. See that ye are not lifted up to pride; yea,
      see that ye do not boast in your own wisdom, nor of your much strength; use boldness, but not
      overbearance; and also see that ye bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love;
      see that ye refrain from idleness; do not pray as the Zoramites do, for ye have seen that they
      pray to be heard of men, and to be praised for their wisdom. Do not say, O God, I thank thee
      that we are better than our brethren; but rather say, O Lord, forgive my unworthiness, and
      remember my brethren in mercy; yea, acknowledge your unworthiness before God at all times. And
      may the Lord bless your soul, and receive you at the last day into his kingdom, to sit down in
      peace. Now go, my son, and teach the word unto this people. Be sober. My son, farewell.

    <text> And now my son, I have somewhat more to say unto thee than what I said unto thy brother:
      for behold, have ye not observed the steadiness of thy brother, his faithfulness, and his
      diligence in keeping the commandments of God? Behold, has he not set a good example for thee?
      For thou didst not give so much heed unto my words as did thy brother, among the people of the
      Zoramites. Now this is what I have against thee: Thou didst go on unto boasting in thy
      strength, and thy wisdom. And this is not all, my son. Thou didst do that which was grievous
      unto me; for thou didst forsake the ministry, and did go over into the land of Siron, among
      the borders of the Lamanites, after the harlot Isabel; yea, she did steal away the hearts of
      many; but this was no excuse for thee, my son. Thou shouldst have tended to the ministry,
      wherewith thou wast entrusted. Know ye not, my son, that these things are an abomination in
      the sight of the Lord; yea, most abominable above all sins, save it be the shedding of
      innocent blood, or denying the Holy Ghost? for behold, if ye deny the Holy Ghost when it once
      hath had place in you, and ye know that ye deny it; behold, this is a sin which is
      unpardonable; yea, and whosoever murdereth against the light and knowledge of God, it is not
      easy for him to obtain forgiveness; yea, I say unto you, my son, that it is not easy for him
      to obtain a forgiveness. And now my son, I would to God that ye had not been guilty of so
      great a crime. I would not dwell upon your crimes, to harrow up your soul, if it were not for
      your good. But behold, ye cannot hide your crimes from God; and except ye repent, they will
      stand as a testimony against you at the last day. Now my son, I would that ye should repent,
      and forsake your sins, and go no more after the lusts of your eyes, but cross yourself in all
      these things; for except ye do this, ye can in no wise inherit the Kingdom of God. O remember,
      and take it upon you, and cross yourself in these things. And I command you to take it upon
      you to counsel your elder brothers in your undertakings; for behold, thou art in thy youth,
      and ye stand in need to be nourished by your brothers. And give heed to their counsel; suffer
      not yourself to be led away by any vain or foolish thing; suffer not that the Devil lead away
      your heart again, after those wicked harlots. Behold, my son, how great iniquity ye brought
      upon the Zoramites: for when they saw your conduct, they would not believe in my words. And
      now the spirit of the Lord doth say unto me, Command thy children to do good, lest they lead
      away the hearts of many people to destruction: therefore I command you, my son, in the fear of
      God, that ye refrain from your iniquities; that ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might
      and strength; that ye lead away the hearts of no more, to do wickedly; but rather return unto
      them, and acknowledge your faults, and retain that wrong which ye have done; seek not after
      riches, nor the vain things of the world; for behold, you cannot carry them with you. And now
      my son, I would say somewhat unto you concerning the coming of Christ. Behold, I say unto you,
      that it is him that surely shall come, to take away the sins of the world; yea, he cometh to
      declare glad tidings of salvation unto his people. And now my son, this was the ministry unto
      which ye were called, to declare these glad tidings unto his people, to prepare their minds;
      or rather that salvation might come unto them, that they may prepare the minds of their
      children to hear the word at the time of his coming. And now I will ease your mind somewhat in
      this subject. Behold, you marvel why these things should be known so long beforehand. Behold,
      I say unto you, Is not a soul at this time as precious unto God, as a soul will be at the time
      of his coming? Is it not as necessary that the plan of redemption should be made known unto
      this people, as well as unto their children? Is it not as easy at this time, for the Lord to
      send his angel to declare these glad tidings unto us, as unto our children; or as after the
      time of his coming? </text>

    <text> Now my son, here is somewhat more I would say unto thee; for I perceive that thy mind is
      worried concerning the resurrection of the dead. --Behold, I say unto you, that there is no
      resurrection; or I would say, in other words, that this mortal does not put on immortality;
      thus corruption does not put on incorruption, until after the coming of Christ. Behold, he
      bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead. But behold, my son, the resurrection is not
      yet. Now I unfold unto you a mystery; nevertheless, there are many mysteries, which are kept,
      that no one knoweth them save God himself. But I shew unto you one thing, which I have
      inquired diligently of God, that I might know; that is, concerning the resurrection. Behold,
      there is a time appointed that shall come forth from the dead. --Now when this time cometh, no
      one knows; but God knoweth the time which is appointed. Now whether there shall be one time,
      or a second time, or a third time, that men shall come forth from the dead, it mattereth not;
      for God knoweth all these things; and it sufficeth me to know that this is the case; that
      there is a time appointed that all shall rise from the dead. Now there must needs be a space
      betwixt the time of death, and the time of the resurrection. And now I would inquire what
      becometh of the souls of men, from this time of death, to the time appointed for the
      resurrection? --Now whether there is more than one time appointed for men to rise, it
      mattereth not; for all do not die at once; and this mattereth not; all is as one day, with
      God; and time only is measured unto men; therefore there is a time appointed unto men, that
      they shall rise from the dead; and there is a space between the time of death and the
      resurrection. And now concerning this space of time. What becometh of the souls of men, is the
      thing which I have inquired diligently of the Lord to know; and this is the thing of which I
      do know. --And when the time cometh when all shall rise, then shall they know that God knoweth
      all the times which are appointed unto man. Now concerning the state of the soul between death
      and the resurrection. Behold, it hath been made known unto me by an angel, that the spirits of
      all men, as soon as they are departed from this mortal body; yea, the spirits of all men,
      whether they be good or evil, are taken home to that God who gave them life. And then shall it
      come to pass that the spirits of those which are righteous, are received into a state of
      happiness, which is called paradise; a state of rest; a state of peace, where they shall rest
      from all their troubles, and from all care, and sorrow, &amp;c. And then shall it come to
      pass, that the spirits of the wicked, yea, which are evil; for behold, they have no part nor
      portion of the spirit of the Lord; for behold, they chose evil works, rather than good;
      therefore the spirit of the Devil did enter into them, and take possession of their house; and
      these shall be cast out into outer darkness; they shall be weeping, and wailing, and gnashing
      of teeth; and this because of their own iniquity; being led captive by the will of the Devil.
      Now this is the state of the souls of the wicked; yea, in darkness, and a state of awful,
      fearful looking for of the fiery indignation of the wrath of God upon them; thus they remain
      in this state, as well as the righteous in paradise, until the time of their resurrection. Now
      there are some that have understood that this state of happiness, and the state of misery of
      the soul, before the resurrection, was a first resurrection. Yea, I admit it may be termed a
      resurrection; the raising of the spirit or the soul, and their consignation to happiness or
      misery, according to the words which have been spoken. And behold, again it hath been spoken,
      that there is a first resurrection; a resurrection of all those which have been, or which are,
      or which shall be, down to the resurrection of Christ from the dead. --Now we do not suppose
      that this first resurrection which is spoken of in this manner, can be the resurrection of the
      souls, and their consignation to happiness or misery. Ye cannot suppose that this is what it
      meaneth. Behold, I say unto you Nay; but it meaneth the re-uniting of the soul with the body
      of those from the days of Adam, down to the resurrection of Christ. Now whether the souls and
      the bodies of those of which have been spoken, shall all be re-united at once, the wicked as
      well as the righteous, I do not say; let it suffice that I say that they all come forth; or in
      other words, their resurrection cometh to pass before the resurrection of those which die
      after the resurrection of Christ. Now my son, I do not say that their resurrection cometh at
      the resurrection of Christ; but behold, I give it as my opinion, that the souls and the bodies
      are re-united, of the righteous, at the resurrection of Christ, and his ascension into Heaven.
      But whether it be at his resurrection, or after, I do not say; but this much I say: That there
      is a space between death and the resurrection of the body, and a state of the soul in
      happiness or in misery, until the time which is appointed of God that the dead shall come
      forth, and be re-united, both soul and body, and be brought to stand before God, and be judged
      according to their works; yea, this bringeth about the restoration of those things of which
      have been spoken by the mouths of the prophets. The soul shall be restored to the body, and
      the body to the soul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to the soul; yea, and
      every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be
      lost, but all things shall be restored to its proper and perfect frame. And now my son, this
      is the restoration of which has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets: And then shall the
      righteous shine forth in the Kingdom of God. But behold, an awful death cometh upon the
      wicked; for they die as to things pertaining to things of righteousness; for they are unclean,
      and no unclean thing can inherit the Kingdom of God; but they are cast out, and consigned to
      partake of the fruits of their labors or their works, which have been evil; and they drink the
      dregs of a bitter cup. </text>

    <text> And now my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the restoration of which has been
      spoken; for behold, some have arrested the Scriptures, and have gone far astray, because of
      this thing. And I perceive that thy mind hath been worried also, concerning this thing. But
      behold, I will explain it unto thee. I say unto thee, my son, that the plan of restoration is
      requisite with the justice of God; for it is requisite that all things be restored to their
      proper order. Behold, it is requisite and just, according to the power and resurrection of
      Christ, that the soul of man should be restored to its body, and that every part of the body
      should be restored to itself. --And it is requisite with the justice of God, that man should
      be judged according to their works; and if their works were good in this life, and the desires
      of their hearts were good, that they should also, at the last day, be restored unto that which
      is good; and if their works are evil, they shall be restored unto him for evil; therefore, all
      things shall be restored to their proper order; every thing to its natural frame; mortality
      raised to immortality; corruption to incorruption; raised to endless happiness, to inherit the
      Kingdom of God, or to endless misery, to inherit the kingdom of the Devil; the one on one
      hand, the other on the other; the one raised to happiness, according to his desires of
      happiness; or good, according to his desires of good; and the other to evil, according to his
      desires of evil; for as he has desired to do evil all the day long, even so shall he have his
      reward of evil, when the night cometh. And so it is on the other hand. If he hath repented of
      his sins, and desired righteousness until the end of his days, even so he shall be rewarded
      unto righteousness. --These are they that are redeemed of the Lord; yea, these are they that
      are taken out, that are delivered from that endless night of darkness; and thus they stand or
      fall; for behold, they are their own judges, whether to do good or do evil.-- Now the decrees
      of God are unalterable; therefore the way is prepared, that whosoever will, may walk therein
      and be saved. And now behold my son, do not risk one more offence against your God upon these
      points of doctrine, which ye hath hitherto risked to commit sin. Do not suppose, because it
      hath been spoken concerning restoration, that ye shall be restored from sin to happiness,
      Behold I say unto you, Wickedness never was happiness. And now, my son, all men that are in a
      state of nature, or I would say, in a carnal state, are in the gall of bitterness, and in the
      bonds of iniquity; they are without God in the world; and they have gone contrary to the
      nature of God; therefore they are in a state contrary to the nature of happiness. And now
      behold, is the meaning of the word restoration, to take a thing of a natural state, and place
      it in an unnatural state, or to place it in a state opposite to its nature? O, my son, this is
      not the case; but the meaning of the word restoration, is to bring back again evil for evil,
      or carnal for carnal, or devlish for devlish; good for that which is good; righteous for that
      which is righteous; just for that which is just; merciful for that which is merciful;
      therefore my son, see that ye are merciful unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously,
      and do good continually; and if ye do all these things, then shall ye receive your reward;
      yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have justice restored unto you
      again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good
      rewarded unto you again; for that which ye doth send out, shall return unto you again, and be
      restored; therefore the word restoration, more fully condemneth the sinner, and justifieth him
      not at all. </text>

    <text> And now, my son, I perceive there is somewhat more which doth worry your mind, which ye
      cannot understand, which is concerning the justice of God, in the punishment of the sinner:
      for ye do try to suppose that it is injustice that the sinner should be consigned to a state
      of misery. Now behold, my son, I will explain this thing unto thee: for behold, after the Lord
      God sent our first parents forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground, from whence he
      was taken; yea, he drew out the man, and he placed at the east end of the garden of Eden,
      Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the tree of life. Now we see
      that the man had became as God, knowing good and evil; and lest he should put forth his hand,
      and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever, that the Lord God placed
      Cherubims and the flaming sword, that he should not partake of the fruit; and thus we see,
      that there was a time granted unto man, to repent, yea, a probationary time, a time to repent
      and serve God. For behold, if Adam had put forth his hand immediately, and partook of the tree
      of life, he would have lived forever, according to the word of God, having no space for
      repentance; yea, and also the word of God would have been void, and the great plan of
      salvation would have been frustrated. But behold, it was appointed unto man to die; therefore
      as they were cut off from the tree of life, therefore they should be cut off from the face of
      the earth; and man became lost forever; yea, they became fallen man. And now we see by this,
      that our first parents were cut off, both temporally and spiritually, from the presence of the
      Lord; and thus we see they became subjects to follow after their own will. Now behold, it was
      not expedient that man should be reclaimed from this temporal death, for that would destroy
      the great plan of happiness; therefore, as the soul could never die, and the fall had brought
      upon all mankind a spiritual death as well as a temporal; that is, they were cut off from the
      presence of the Lord; therefore it was expedient that mankind should be reclaimed from this
      spiritual death; therefore as they become carnal, sensual and devlish, by nature, this
      probationary state became a state for them to prepare: it became a preparatory state. And now
      remember my son, if it were not for the plan of redemption, (laying it aside,) as soon as they
      were dead, their souls were miserable, being cut off from the presence of the Lord. And now
      there was no means to reclaim men from this fallen state which man had brought upon himself,
      because of his own disobedience; therefore, according to justice, the plan of redemption could
      not be brought about, only, on conditions of repentance of men in this probationary state;
      yea, this preparatory state; for except it were for these conditions, mercy could not take
      effect except it should destroy the work of justice. Now the work of justice could not be
      destroyed: if so, God would cease to be God. And thus we see that all mankind were fallen, and
      they were in the grasp of justice; yea, the justice of God, which consigned them forever to be
      cut off from his presence. And now the plan of mercy could not be brought about, except an
      atonement should be made; therefore God himself atoneth for the sins of the world, to bring
      about a plan of mercy, to appease the demands of justice, that God might be a perfect, just
      God, and a merciful God. Also, now repentance could not come unto men, except there were a
      punishment, which also was as eternal as the life of the soul should be, affixed opposite to
      the plan of happiness, which was as eternal also as the life of the soul. --Now, how could a
      man repent, except he should sin? How could he sin, if there was no law? How could there be a
      law, saved there was a punishment? Now there was a punishment affixed, and a just law given,
      which brought remorse of conscience unto man. Now if there was no law given, if a man murdered
      he should die, would he be afraid he should die if he should murder? And also, if there was no
      law given against sin, men would not be afraid to sin. And if there was no law given if men
      sinned, what could justice do, or mercy either, for they would have no claim upon the
      creature? But there is a law given, and a punishment affixed, and repentance granted; which
      repentance, mercy claimeth; otherwise, justice claimeth the creature, and executeth the law,
      and the law inflicteth the punishment; if not so, the works of justice would be destroyed, and
      God would cease to be God. But God ceaseth not to be God, and mercy claimeth the penitent, and
      mercy cometh because of the atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of
      the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of god; and
      thus they are restored into his presence, to be judged according to their works; according to
      the law and justice; for behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also mercy claimeth
      all which is her own; and thus, none but the truly penitent are saved. What do ye suppose that
      mercy can rob justice? I say unto you, Nay; not one whit. If so, God would cease to be God.
      And thus God bringeth about his great and eternal purposes, which was prepared from the
      foundation of the world. And thus cometh about the salvation and the redemption of men, and
      also their destruction and misery; therefore, O my son, whosoever will come, and partake of
      the waters of life freely; and whosoever will not come, the same is not compelled to come; but
      in the last day, it shall be restored unto him, according to his deeds. If he hath desired to
      do evil, and hath not repented in his days, behold, evil shall be done unto him, according to
      the restoration of God. And now my son, I desire that ye should let these things trouble you
      no more, and only let your sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall bring you down unto
      repentance. O my son, I desire that ye should deny the justice of God no more. Do not endeavor
      to excuse yourself in the least point, because of your sins, by denying the justice of God,
      but do you let the justice of God, and his mercy, and long suffering, having full sway in your
      heart; but let it bring you down to the dust, in humility. And now, O my son, ye are called of
      God to preach the word unto this people. And now, my son, go thy way, declare the word with
      truth and soberness, that thou mayest bring souls unto repentance, that the great plan of
      mercy may have claim upon them. --And may God grant unto you even according to my words.
      --Amen. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass, that the sons of Alma did go forth among the people, to declare
      the word unto them. And Alma also, himself, could not rest, and he also went forth. --Now we
      shall say no more concerning their preaching, except that they preached the word, and the
      truth, according to the spirit of prophecy and revelation; and they preached after the holy
      order of God, by which they were called. And now I return to an account of the wars between
      the Nephites and the Lamanites, in the eighteenth year of the reign of the Judges. For behold,
      it came to pass that the Zoramites became Lamanites; therefore, in the commencement of the
      eighteenth year, the people of the Nephites saw that the Lamanites were coming upon them;
      therefore they made preparations for war; yea, they gathered together their armies in the land
      of Jershon. And it came to pass that the Lamanites came with their thousands; and they came
      into the land of Antionam, which was the land of the Zoramites; and a man by the name of
      Zerahemnah was their leader. And now as the Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous
      disposition than the Lamanites were, in an end of themselves, therefore Zerahemnah appointed
      Chief Captains over the Lamanites, and they were all the Amalekites and the Zoramites. Now
      this he done, that he might preserve their hatred towards the Nephites; that he might bring
      them into subjection to the accomplishment of his designs; for behold, his designs were to
      stir up the Lamanites to anger against the Nephites; this he done that he might usurp great
      power over them; and also that he might gain power over the Nephites, by bringing them into
      bondage, &amp;c. And now the design of the Nephites were to support their lands, and their
      houses, and their wives, and their children, that they might preserve them from the hands of
      their enemies, and also, that they might preserve their rights and their privileges; yea, and
      also their liberty, that they might worship God according to their desires; for they knew that
      if they should fall into the hands of the Lamanites, that whosoever should worship God, in
      spirit and in truth, the true and the living God, the Lamanites would destroy; yea, they also
      knew the extreme hatred of the Lamanites towards their brethren, which were the people of
      Anti-Nephi-Lehi; which were called the people of Ammon; and they would not take up arms; yea,
      they had entered into a covenant, and they would not break it; therefore, they should fall
      into the hands of the Lamanites, they would be destroyed. And the Nephites would not suffer
      that they be destroyed; therefore they gave them lands for their inheritance. And the people
      of Ammon did give unto the Nephites a large portion of their substance, to support their
      armies; and thus the Nephites were compelled, alone, to withstand against the Lamanites, which
      were a compound of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, and all those which had
      dissented from the Nephites, which were Amalekites, and Zoramites, and the descendants of the
      priests of Noah. Now those descendants were as numerous, nearly, as were the Nephites; and
      thus the Nephites were obliged to contend with their brethren, even unto bloodshed. And it
      came to pass, as the armies of the Lamanites had gathered together in the land of Antionum,
      behold the armies of the Nephites were prepared to meet them in the land of Jershon. Now the
      leader of the Nephites, or the man which had been appointed to be the Chief Captain over the
      Nephites: Now the Chief Captain took the command of all the armies of the Nephites; and his
      name was Moroni; and Moroni took all the command, and the governments of their wars. --And he
      was only twenty and five years old when he was appointed Chief Commander over the armies of
      the Nephites. And it came to pass that he met the Lamanites in the borders of Jershon, and his
      people were armed with swords, and with cimeters, and all manner of weapons of war. And it
      came to pass, that when the armies of the Lamanites saw that the people of Nephi, or that
      Moroni had prepared his people with breast-plates, and with arm-shields; yea, and also shields
      to defend their heads; and also they were dressed with thick clothing. Now the army of
      Zerahemnah was not prepared with any such thing. They had only their swords, and their
      cimeters, their bows and their arrows, their stones and their slings; but they were naked,
      save it were a skin which was girded about their loins; yea, all were naked, save it were the
      Zoramites and the Amalekites. But they were not armed with breast-plates, nor shields;
      therefore they were exceeding afraid of the armies of the Nephites, because of their armour,
      notwithstanding their number being so much greater than the Nephites. Behold, now it came to
      pass, that they durst not come against the Nephites in the border of Jershon; therefore they
      departed out of the land of Antionum, into the wilderness, and took their journey round about
      in the wilderness, away by the heads of the river Sidon, that they might come into the land of
      Manti, and take possession of the land; for they did suppose that the armies of Moroni would
      know whither they had gone. But it came to pass, as soon as they had departed into the
      wilderness, Moroni sent spies into the wilderness, to watch their camp; and Moroni, also
      knowing of the prophecies of Alma, sent certain men unto him, desiring him that he should
      inquire of the Lord whither the armies of the Nephites should go, to defend themselves against
      the Lamanites. And it came to pass that the word of the Lord came unto Alma; and Alma informed
      the messengers of Moroni that the armies of the Lamanites were marching round about in the
      wilderness, that they might come over into the land of Manti, that they might commence an
      attack upon the more weak part of the people. And those messengers went and delivered the
      message unto Moroni. Now Moroni, leaving a part of his army in the land of Jershon, lest by
      any means, a part of the Lamanites should come into the land and take possession of the city;
      and Moroni took the remainder part of his army and marched over into the land of Manti. And he
      caused that all the people in that quarter of the land, should gather themselves together to
      battle, against the Lamanites, to defend their lands and their country, their rights and their
      liberties; therefore they were prepared against the time of the coming of the Lamanites. And
      it came to pass, that Moroni caused that his army should be secreted in the valley which was
      near the bank of the river Sidon, which was on the west of the river Sidon, in the wilderness.
      And Moroni placed spies round about that he might know when the camp of the Lamanites should
      come. And now as Moroni knew the intentions of the Lamanites, that it was there intention to
      destroy their brethren, or to subject them and bring them into bondage, that they might
      establish a kingdom unto themselves, over all the land; and he also knowing that it was the
      only desire of the Nephites to preserve their lands and their liberty, and their church,
      therefore he thought it no sin that he should defend them by stratagem; therefore he found, by
      his spies, which course the lamanites were to take. Therefore he divided his army, and brought
      a part over into the valley, and concealed them on the east, and on the south of the hill
      Riplah; and the remainder he concealed in the west valley, on the west of the river Sidon, and
      so down into the borders of the land of Manti. And thus having placed his army according to
      his desire, he was prepared to meet them. And it came to pass that the Lamanites came up on
      the north of the hill where a part of the army of Moroni was concealed. And it came to pass
      that as the Lamanites had passed the hill Riplah, and came into the valley, and began to cross
      the river Sidon, the army which was concealed on the south of the hill, who was led by a man
      whose name was Lehi; and he led his army forth and encircled the Lamanites about, on the east,
      in their rear. And it came to pass that the Lamanites, when they saw the Nephites coming upon
      them in the rear, turned them about, and began to contend with the army of Lehi; and the work
      of death commenced on both sides; but it was more dreadful on the part of the Lamanites; for
      their nakedness was exposed to heavy blows of the Nephites, with their swords and their
      cimeters, which brought death almost at every stroke; while on the other hand, there was now
      and then a man fell among the Nephites, by their swords, and the loss of blood; they being
      shielded from the more vital parts of the body, or the more vital parts of the body being
      shielded from the strokes of the Lamanites, by their breast-plates, and their arm-shields, and
      their head-plates; and thus the Nephites did carry on the work of death among the Lamanites.
      And it came to pass that the Lamanites became frightened, because of the great destruction
      among them, even until they began to flee towards the river Sidon. And they were persued by
      Lehi and his men, and they were driven by Lehi into the waters of Sidon; and they crossed the
      waters of Sidon. And Lehi retained his armies upon the bank of the river Sidon, that they
      should not cross. And it came to pass that Moroni and his army met the Lamanites in the
      valley, on the other side of the river Sidon. --And it came to pass that Moroni and his army
      began to fall upon them, and to slay them. And it came to pass that the Lamanites did flee
      again before them, towards the land of Manti; and they were met again by the armies of Moroni.
      --Now in this case, the Lamanites did fight exceedingly; yea, never had the Lamanites been
      known to have fought with such exceeding great strength and courage; no, not even from the
      beginning; and they were inspired by the Zoramites, and the Amalekites, which were their Chief
      Captains and leaders, and by Zerahemnah, who was their Chief Captain, or their chief leader
      and commander; yea, they did fight like dragons; and many of the Nephites were slain by their
      hands; yea, for they did smite in two many of their head-plates; and they did pierce many of
      their breast-plates; and they did smite off many of their arms; and thus the Lamanites did
      smite in their fierce anger. Nevertheless, the Nephites were inspired by a better cause; for
      they were not fighting for monarchy nor power; but they were fighting for their homes, and
      their liberties, their wives, and their children, and their all; yea, for their rites of
      worship, and their church; and they were doing that which they felt it was the duty which they
      owed to their God; for the Lord said unto them, and also unto their fathers. That inasmuch as
      ye are not guilty of the first offence, neither the second, ye shall not suffer yourselves to
      be slain by the hands of your enemies. And again: The Lord hath said That ye shall defend your
      families, even unto bloodshed; therefore, for this cause were the Nephites contending with the
      Lamanites, to defend themselves, and their families, and their lands, their country, and their
      rights, and their religion. And it came to pass that when the men of Moroni saw the fierceness
      and the anger of the Lamanites, they were about to shrink and flee from them. And Moroni,
      perceiving their intent, sent forth and inspired their hearts with these thoughts; yea, the
      thoughts of their lands, their liberty, yea, their freedom from bondage. And it came to pass
      that they turned upon the Lamanites, and they cried with one voice unto the Lord their God,
      for their liberty, and their freedom from bondage. And they began to stand against the
      Lamanites with power; and in that self-same hour that they cried unto the Lord for their
      freedom, the Lamanites began to flee before them; and they fled into the waters of Sidon. Now
      the Lamanites were more numerous; yea, by more than double the number of the Nephites;
      nevertheless, they were driven insomuch that they were gathered together in one body, in the
      valley, upon the bank, by the river Sidon; therefore the armies of Moroni encircled them
      about; yea, even on both sides of the river; for behold, on the east, were the men of Lehi;
      therefore when Zerahemnah saw the men of Lehi on the east of the river Sidon, and the armies
      of Moroni on the west of the river Sidon, that they were encircled about by the Nephites, they
      were struck with terror, he commanded his men that they should stop shedding their blood.

    <text> And it came to pass that they did stop, and withdrew a pace from them. And Moroni said
      unto Zerahemnah, Behold, Zerahemnah, that we do not desire to be men of blood. Ye know that ye
      are in our hands, yet we do not desire to slay you. Behold, we have not come out to battle
      against you, that we might shed your blood, for power; neither do we desire to bring any one
      to the yoke of bondage. But this is the very cause for which ye have come against us; yea, and
      ye are angry with us because of our religion. But now ye behold that the Lord is with us; and
      ye behold that he hath delivered you into our hands. And now I would that ye should understand
      that this is done unto us because of our religion and our faith in Christ. And now ye see that
      ye cannot destroy this our faith. Now ye see that this is the true faith of God; yea, ye see
      that God will support, and keep, and preserve us, so long as we are faithful unto him, and
      unto our faith, and our religion; and never will the Lord suffer that we shall be destroyed,
      except we should fall into transgression, and deny our faith. And now, Zerahemnah, I command
      you, in the name of that all-powerful God, who hath strengthened our arms, that we have gained
      power over you by our faith, by our religion, and by our rites of worship, and by our church,
      and by the sacred support which we owe to our wives, and our children, by that liberty which
      binds us to our lands and our country; yea, and also by the maintenance of the sacred word of
      God, to which we owe all our happiness; and by all that is most dear unto us; yea, and this is
      not all; I command you by all the desires which ye have for life, that ye deliver up your
      weapons of war unto us, and we will seek not your blood, but we will spare your lives, if ye
      will go your way, and come not again to war against us. --And now if ye do not this, behold,
      ye are in our hands, and I will command my men that they shall fall upon you, and inflict the
      wounds of death in your bodies, that ye may become extinct; and then we will see who shall
      have power over this people; yea, we will see who shall be brought into bondage. And now it
      came to pass that when Zerahemnah had heard these sayings, he came forth and delivered up his
      sword and his cimeter, and his bow, into the hands of Moroni, and saith unto him, Behold, here
      is our weapons of war; we will deliver them up unto you, and we will not suffer ourselves to
      take an oath unto you, which we know that we shall break, and also our children; but take our
      weapons of war, and suffer that we may depart into the wilderness; otherwise we will retain
      our swords, and we will perish or conquer. Behold, we are not of your faith; we do not believe
      that it is God that hath delivered us into your hands; but we believe that it is your cunning
      that hath preserved you from our swords. Behold, it is your breast-plates, and your shields
      that hath preserved you. And now when Zerahemnah had made an ending of speaking these words,
      Moroni returned the sword, and the weapons of war which he had received, unto Zerahemnah,
      saying, Behold, we will end the conflict. Now I cannot retain the words which I have spoken;
      therefore, as the Lord liveth, ye shall not depart, except ye depart with an oath, that ye
      will not return again against us to war. Now as ye are in our hands, we will spill your blood
      upon the ground, or ye shall submit to the conditions to which I have proposed. And now when
      Moroni had said these words, Zerahemnah retained his sword, and he was angry with Moroni, and
      he rushed forward that he might slay Moroni; but as he raised his sword, behold, one of
      Moroni's soldier smote it even to the earth; and it broke by the hilt; and he also smote
      Zerahemnah, that he took off his scalp, and it fell to the earth. And Zerahemnah withdrew from
      before them, into the midst of his soldiers. And it came to pass that the soldier that stood
      by, which smote off the scalp of Zerahemnah, took up the scalp from off the ground, by the
      hair, and laid it upon the point of his sword, and stretched it forth unto them, saying unto
      them with a loud voice, saying: Even as this scalp hath fallen to the earth, which is the
      scalp of your Chief, so shall ye fall to earth, except ye will deliver up your weapons of war,
      and depart, with a covenant of peace. Now there were many, when they heard these words, and
      saw the scalp which was upon the sword, they were struck with fear, and many came forth and
      threw down their weapons of war, at the feet of Moroni , and entered into a covenant of peace.
      And as many as entered into a covenant, they suffered to depart into the wilderness. Now it
      came to pass that Zerahemnah was exceeding wroth, and he did stir up the remainder of his
      soldiers to anger, to contend more powerfully against the Nephites. And now Moroni was angry,
      because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded his people that they
      should fall upon them and slay them. And it came to pass that they began to slay them; yea,
      and the Lamanites did contend with their swords and their mights. But behold, their naked
      skins, and their bare heads, were exposed to the sharp swords of the Nephites; yea, behold,
      they were pierced and smitten; yea, and did fall exceeding fast before the swords of the
      Nephites; and they began to be swept down, even as the soldier of Moroni had prophesied. Now
      Zerahemnah, when he saw that they were all about to be destroyed, he cried mightily unto
      Moroni, promising that he would covenant, and also his people, with them, if they would spare
      the remainder of their lives, that they never would come to war again against them. And it
      came to pass that Moroni caused that the work of death should cease again among the people.
      And it came to pass, that he took the weapons of war from the Lamanites; and after they had
      entered into a covenant with him of peace, they were suffered to depart into the wilderness.
      Now the number of their dead were not numbered, because of the greatness of the number; yea,
      the number of their dead were exceeding great, both on the Nephites, and on the Lamanites.
      --And it came to pass that they did cast their dead into the waters of Sidon; and they have
      gone forth, and are buried in the depths of the sea. And the armies of the Nephites, or of
      Moroni, returned, and came to their houses, and their lands. And thus ended the eighteenth
      year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi. And thus ended the record of Alma,
      which was wrote upon the plates of Nephi. </text>

    <text> Behold, now it came to pass that the people of Nephi were exceedingly rejoiced, because
      the Lord God again delivered them out of the hands of their enemies; therefore they gave
      thanks unto the Lord their God; yea, and they did fast much and pray much, and they did
      worship God exceeding great joy. And it came to pass in the nineteeneth year of the reign of
      the Judges over the people of Nephi, that Alma came unto his son Helaman, and saith unto him,
      Believest thou the words which I spake unto thee concerning those records which have been
      kept? And Helaman saith unto him, Yea, I believe. --And Alma saith again, Believest thou in
      Jesus Christ, which shall come? And he saith, Yea, I believe all the words which thou hast
      spoken. And Alma saith unto him again, Will ye keep my commandments? And he said, Yea, I will
      keep thy commandments with all my heart. Then Alma saith unto him, Blessed art thou; and the
      Lord shall prosper thee in this land. But behold, I have somewhat to prophesy unto thee; but
      what I prophesy unto thee, ye shall not make known; yea, what I prophesy unto thee shall not
      be made known, even until the prophecy is fulfilled; therefore write the words which I shall
      say. And these are the words: Behold, I perceive that this very people, the Nephites,
      according to the spirit of revelation which is in me, in four hundred years from the time that
      Jesus Christ shall manifest himself unto them, shall dwindle in unbelief; yea, and then shall
      they see wars and pestilences, yea, famines and bloodshed, even until the people of Nephi
      shall become extinct; yea, and this because they shall dwindle in unbelief, and fall into the
      works of darkness and lasciviousness, and all manner of iniquities; yea, I say unto you, that
      because they shall sin against so great light and knowledge; yea, I say unto you, that from
      this day, even the fourth generation shall not all pass away, before this great iniquity shall
      come; and when that great day cometh, behold, the time very soon cometh that those which are
      now, or the seed of those which are now numbered among the people of Nephi, shall no more be
      numbered among the people of Nephi; but whosoever remaineth, and is not destroyed in that
      great and dreadful day, shall be numbered among the Lamanites, and shall become like unto them
      all, save it be a few, which shall be called the disciples of the Lord; and them shall the
      Lamanites pursue, even until they shall become extinct. And now, because of iniquity, this
      prophecy shall be fulfilled. And now it came to pass that after Alma has said these things to
      Helama, he blessed him, and also his other sons; and he also blessed the earth, for the
      righteous sake. And he said, Thus saith the Lord God: Cursed shall be the land, yea, this
      land, unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, unto destruction, which do wickedly,
      when they are fully ripe; and as I have said, so shall it be: for this is the cursing and the
      blessing of God upon the land, for the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of
      allowance. And now, when Alma had said these words, he blessed the church, yea, all those
      which should stand fast in the faith, from that time henceforth; and when Alma had done this,
      he departed out of the land of Zarahemla, as if to go into the land of Melek. --And it came to
      pass that he was never heard of more; as to his death or his burial, we know not of. Behold,
      this we know, that he was a righteous man; and the saying went abroad in the church, that he
      was taken up by the spirit, or buried by the hand of the Lord, even as Moses. But behold, the
      Scripture saith the Lord took Moses unto himself; and we suppose that he hath also received
      Alma in the spirit, unto himself; therefore, for this cause, we know nothing concerning his
      death or burial. And now it came to pass in the commencement of the nineteenth year of the
      reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi, that Helaman went forth among the people to
      declare the word unto them: for behold, because of their wars with the Lamanites, and the many
      little dissentions and disturbances which had been among the people, it became expedient that
      the word of God should be declared among them; yea, and that a regulation should be made
      throughout the church; therefore Helaman and his brethren went forth to establish the church
      again in all the land, yea, in every city throughout all the land which was possessed by the
      people of Nephi. And it came to pass that they did appoint priests and teachers throughout all
      the land, over all the churches. And now it came to pass that after Helaman and his brethren
      had appointed priests and teachers over the churches, that there arose a dissention among
      them, and they would not give heed to the words of Helaman and his brethren; but they grew
      proud, being lifted up in their hearts, because of their exceeding great riches; therefore
      they grew rich in their own eyes, and would not give heed to their words, to walk uprightly
      before God. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that as many as would not hearken to the words of Helaman and his
      brethren, were gathered together against their brethren. And now behold, they were exceeding
      wroth, insomuch that they were determined to slay them. Now the leader of those which were
      wroth against their brethren, was a large and a strong man; and his name was Amalickiah. And
      Amalickiah was desirous to be a king; and those people which were wroth, were also desirous
      that he should be their king; and they were the greater part of them the lower Judges of the
      land; and they were seeking power. And they had been led by the flatteries of Amalickiah, that
      if they would support him, and establish him to be their king, that he would make them rulers
      over the people. Thus they were led away by Amalickiah, to dissentions, notwithstanding the
      preaching of Helaman and his brethren; yea, notwithstanding their exceeding great care over
      the church, for they were High Priests over the church. And there were many in the church
      which believed in the flattering words of Amalickiah; therefore they dissented even from the
      church; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi exceeding precarious and dangerous,
      notwithstanding their great victory which they had had over the Lamanites, and their great
      rejoicings which they had had, because of their deliverance by the hands of the Lord. Thus we
      see how quick the children of men doth forget the Lord their God; yea, how quick to do
      iniquity, and to be led away by the evil one; yea, and we also see the great wickedness one
      very wicked man can cause to take place among the children of men; yea, we see that
      Amalickiah, because he was a man of cunning devices, and a man of many flattering words, that
      he led away the hearts of many people to do wickedly; yea, and to seek to destroy the church
      of God, and to destroy the foundation of liberty which God had granted unto them, or which
      blessing God had sent upon the face of the land, for the righteous sake. And now it came to
      pass that when Moroni, which was the chief commander of the armies of the Nephites, had heard
      of these dissentions, he was angry with Amalickiah. And it came to pass that he rent his coat;
      and he took a piece thereof, and wrote upon it, In memory of our God, our religion, and
      freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children; and he fastened it upon the end of a pole
      thereof. And he fastened his head-plate, and his breast- plate, and his shields, and girded on
      his armour about his loins; and he took the pole, which had on the end thereof his rent coat.
      (and he called it the title of liberty,) and he bowed himself to the earth, and he prayed
      mightily unto his God for the blessings of liberty to rest upon his brethren so long as there
      should a band of Christians remain to possess the land: for thus were all the true believers
      of Christ, which belonged to the church of God, called by those which did not belong to the
      church; and those who did belong to the church were faithful; yea, all those who were true
      believers in Christ, took upon them, gladly, the name of Christ, or Christians, as they were
      called, because of their belief in Christ, which should come; and therefore, at this time,
      Moroni prayed that the cause of the Christians, and the freedom of the land, might be
      favored.-- And it came to pass that when he had poured out his soul, he gave all the land
      which was south of the land Desolation; yea, and in fine, all the land, both on the north and
      on the south, a chosen land , and the land of liberty. --And he saith, Surely God shall not
      suffer that we, who are despised because we take upon us the name of Christ, shall be trodden
      down and destroyed, until we bring it upon us, by our own transgressions. And when Moroni had
      said these words, he went forth among the people, waving the rent of his garment in the air,
      that all might see the writing which he had wrote upon the rent, and crying with a loud voice,
      saying: Behold, whosoever will maintain this title upon the land, let them come forth in the
      strength of the Lord, and enter into a covenant that they will maintain their rights, and
      their religion, that the Lord God may bless them. And it came to pass that when Moroni had
      proclaimed these words, behold, the people came running together, with their armours girded
      about their loins, rending their garments in token, or as a covenant, that they would not
      forsake the Lord their God; or, in other words, if they should transgress the commandment of
      God, or fall into transgressions, and be ashamed to take upon them the name of Christ, the
      Lord should rend them even as they rent their garments. Now this was the covenant which they
      made; and they cast their garments at the feet of Moroni, saying: We covenant with our God
      that we shall be destroyed, even as our brethren in the land northward, if we shall fall into
      transgression; yea, he may cast us at the feet of our enemies, even as we have cast our
      garments at thy feet, to trodden under foot, if we shall fall into transgression. Moroni saith
      unto them, Behold, we are a remnant of the seed of Jacob; yea, we are a remnant of the seed of
      Joseph, whose coat was rent by his brethren, into many pieces; yea, and now behold, let us
      remember to keep the commandments of God, or our garments shall be rent by our brethren, and
      we be cast into prison, or be sold, or be slain; yea, let us preserve our liberty, as a
      remnant of Joseph; yea, let us remember the words of Jacob, before his death; for behold, he
      saw that a part of the remnant of the coat of Joseph was preserved, and had not decayed. And
      he saith, Even as this remnant of garment of my sons hath been preserved, so shall a remnant
      of the seed of my son be preserved by the hand of God, and be taken unto himself, while the
      remainder of the seed of Joseph shall perish, even as the remnant of his garment. Now behold,
      this giveth my soul sorrow; nevertheless, my soul hath joy in my son, because that part of his
      seed which shall be taken unto God. Now behold, this was the language of Jacob. And now who
      knoweth but what the remnant of the seed of Joseph, which shall perish as his garment, are
      those which have dissented from us; yea, and even it shall be us, if we do not stand fast in
      the faith of Christ. And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words, he went
      forth, and also sent forth in all the parts of the land where there were dissentions, and
      gathered together all the people which were desirous to maintain their liberty, to stand
      against Amalickiah, and those which had dissented, which were called Amalickiahites. And it
      came to pass that when Amalickiah saw that the people of Moroni were more numerous than the
      Amalickiahites; and he also saw that his people were doubtful concerning the justice of the
      cause in which they had undertaken; therefore, fearing that he should not gain the point, he
      took those of his people which would, and departed into the land of Nephi. Now Moroni thought
      it was not expedient that the Lamanites should have any more strength; therefore he thought to
      cut off the people of Amalickiah, or to take them and bring them back, and put Amalickiah to
      death; yea, for he knew that they would stir up the Lamanites to anger against them, and cause
      them to come to battle against them; and this he knew that Amalickiah would do, that he might
      obtain his purposes; therefore Moroni thought it was expedient that he should take his armies,
      which had gathered themselves together and armed themselves. and entered into a covenant to
      keep the peace: --And it came to pass that he took his army, and marched out into the
      wilderness, to cut off the course of Amalickiah in the wilderness. And it came to pass that he
      did according to his desires, and marched forth into the wilderness, and headed the armies of
      Amalickiah. And it came to pass that Amalickiah fled with a small number of his men, and the
      remainder were delivered up into the hands of Moroni, and were taken back into the land of
      Zarahemla. Now Moroni being a man which was appointed by the Chief Judges and the voice of the
      people, therefore he had power according to his will, with the armies of the Nephites, to
      establish and to exercise authority over them. And it came to pass that whomsoever of the
      Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they
      might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death; and there was but few which
      denied the covenant of freedom. And it came to pass also, that he caused the title of liberty
      to be hoisted upon every tower which was in all the land, which was possessed by the Nephites;
      and thus Moroni planted the standard of liberty among the Nephites. And they began to have
      peace again in the land; and thus they did maintain peace in the land, until nearly the end of
      the nineteenth year of the reign of the Judges. And Helaman and the High Priests did also
      maintain order in the church; yea, even for the space of four years, did they have much peace
      and rejoicing in the church. And it came to pass that there were many who died, firmly
      believing that their souls were redeemed by the Lord Jesus Christ; thus they went out of the
      world rejoicing. And there were some who died with fevers, which at some seasons of the year,
      was very frequent in the land; but not so much so with fevers, because of the excellent
      qualities of the many plants and roots which God had prepared, to remove the cause of diseases
      which was subsequent to man, by the nature of the climate. But there were many who died with
      old age; and those who died in the faith of Christ, are happy in him, as we must needs
      suppose. </text>

    <text> Now we will return in our record, to Amalickiah, and those which had fled with him into
      the wilderness: for behold, he had taken those which went with him, and went up into the land
      of Nephi, among the Lamanites, and did stir up the Lamanites to anger, against the people of
      Nephi, inasmuch that the king of the Lamanites sent a proclamation throughout all his land,
      among all his people, that they should gather themselves together again, to go to battle
      against the Nephites. And it came to pass that when the proclamation had gone forth among
      them, they were exceeding fraid; yea, they feared to displease the king, and they also feared
      to go to battle against the Nephites, lest they should lose their lives. And it came to pass
      that they would not, or the more part of them would not obey the commandments of the king. And
      now it came to pass that the king was wroth, because of their disobedience; therefore he gave
      Amalickiah the command of that part of his army which was obedient unto his commands, and
      commanded him that he should go forth and compel them to arms. Now behold, this was the desire
      of Amalickiah: for he being a very subtle man to do evil, therefore he laid the plan in his
      heart to dethrone the king of the Lamanites. And now he had got the command of those parts of
      the Lamanites which were in the favor of the king; and he sought to gain favor of those which
      were not obedient; therefore he went forward to the place which was called Onidah, for thither
      had all the Lamanites fled; for they discovered the army coming, and supposing that they were
      coming to destroy them, therefore they fled to Odinah, to the place of arms. --And they had
      appointed a man to be a king and a leader over them, being fixed in their minds with a
      determined resolution that they would not be subjected to go against the Nephites. And it came
      to pass that they had gathered themselves together upon the top of the mount which was called
      Antipas, in preparation to battle. Now it was not Amalickiah.s intention to give them battle,
      according to the commandments of the king; but behold, it was his intention to gain favor with
      the armies of the Lamanites, that he might place himself at their head, and dethrone the king,
      and take possession of the kingdom. And behold, it came to pass that he caused his army to
      pitch their tents in the valley which was near the mount Antipas. And it came to pass that
      when it was night, he sent a secret embassy into the mount Antipas, desiring that the leader
      of those which were on the mount, whose name was Lehonti, that he should come down to the foot
      of the mount, for he desired to speak with him. And it came to pass that when Lehonti received
      the message, he durst not go down to the foot of the mount. And it came to pass that
      Amalickiah sent again a second time, desiring him to come down. And it came to pass that
      Lehonti would not; and he sent again the third time. And it came to pass that when Alamickiah
      found that he could not get Lehonti to come down off from the mount, he went up into the
      mount, nearly to Lehonti's camp; and he sent again the fourth time, his message unto Lehonti,
      desiring that he would come down, and that he would bring his guards with him. And it came to
      pass that when Lehonti had come down with his guards to Amalickiah, that Amalickiah desired
      him to come down with his army in the night time, and surround those men in their camps, over
      whom the king gave him command, and he would deliver them up into Lehonti's hands, if he would
      make him, (Amalickiah,) a second leader over the whole army. And it came to pass that Lehonti
      came down with his men, and surrounded the men of Amalickiah, so that before they awoke at the
      dawn of the day, they were surrounded by the armies of Lehonti. And it came to pass that when
      they saw that they were surrounded, they plead with Amalickiah that he would suffer them to
      fall in with their brethren, that they might not be destroyed. Now this was the very thing
      which Amalickiah desired. And it came to pass that he delivered his men, contrary to the
      commands of the king. Now this was the thing that Amalickiah desired, that he might accomplish
      his designs in dethroning the king. Now it was the custom among the Lamanites, if their chief
      leader was killed, to appoint the second leader to be their chief leader. And it came to pass
      that Amalickiah caused that one of his servants administer poison, by degrees, to Lehonti,
      that he died. Now when Lehonti was dead, the Lamanites appointed Amalickiah to be their leader
      and their chief commander. And it came to pass that Amalickiah marched with his armies (for he
      had gained his desires) to the land of Nephi, to the city of Nephi, which was the chief city.
      And the king came out to meet him, with his guards: for he supposed that Amalickiah had
      fulfilled his commands, and that Amalickiah had gathered together so great an army for to go
      against the Nephites to battle. But behold, as the king came out to meet him, Amalickiah
      caused that his servants should go forth to meet the king. And they went and bowed themselves
      before the king, as if to reverence him, because of his greatness. And it came to pass that
      the king put forth his hand to raise them, as was the custom of the Lamanites, and a token of
      peace, which custom they had taken from the Nephites. And it came to pass that when he had
      raised the first from the ground, behold, he stabbed the king to the heart; and he fell to the
      earth. Now the servants of the king fled; and the servants of Amalickiah raised a cry, saying:
      Behold, the servants of the king have stabbed him to the heart, and he has fell, and they have
      fled; behold, come and see. And it came to pass that Amalickiah commanded that his armies
      should march forth, and see what bad happened to the king; and when they had come to the spot,
      and found the king lying in his gore, Amalickiah pretended to be wroth, and said, Whosoever
      loved the king, let him go forth and pursue his servants, that they may be slain. And it came
      to pass that when all they who had loved the king, when they had heard these words, came forth
      and pursued after the servants of the king. Now when the servants of the king saw an army
      pursuing after them, they were frightened again, and fled into the wilderness, and came over
      into the land of Zarahemla, and joined the people of Ammon; and the army which pursued after
      them, returned, having pursued after them in vain: and thus Amalickiah, by his fraud, gained
      the hearts of the people. And it came to pass on the morrow, he entered the city of Nephi,
      with his armies, and took possession of the city. And now it came to pass that the queen, when
      she had heard that the king was slain: for Amalickiah had sent an embassy to the queen,
      informing her that the king had been slain by his servants; that he had pursued them with his
      army, but it was in vain, and they had made their escape: Therefore when the queen had
      received this message, she sent unto Amalickiah, desiring him that he would spare the people
      of the city; and she also desired him that he should come in unto her; and she also desired
      him that he would bring witnesses with him, to testify concerning the death of the king. And
      it came to pass that Amalickiah took the same servant that slew the king, and also they which
      were with him, and went in unto the queen, unto the place where she sat; and they all
      testified unto her that the king was slain by his own servants; and they said, also, They have
      fled: Does not this testify against them? And thus they satisfied the queen concerning the
      death of the king. And it came to pass that Amalickiah sought the favor of the queen, and took
      her unto him to wife; and thus by his fraud, and by the assistance of his cunning servants, he
      obtained the kingdom; yea, he was acknowledged king throughout all the land, among all the
      people of the Lamanites, which was composed of the Lamanites, and the Lamanites, and the
      Ishmaelites, and all the dissenters of the Nephites, from the reign of Nephi down to the
      present time. Now these dissenters, having the same instruction and the same information of
      the Nephites; yea, having been instructed in the same knowledge of the Lord; nevertheless, it
      is strange to relate, not long after their dissentions, they became more hardened and
      impenitent, and more wild, wicked and ferocious, then the Lamanites; drinking in the
      traditions of the Lamanites; giving away to indolence, and all manner of lasciviousness; yea,
      entirely forgetting the Lord their God. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that as soon as Amalickiah had obtained the kingdom, he began to
      inspire the hearts of the Lamanites against the people of Nephi; yea, he did appoint men to
      speak unto the Lamanites from their towers, against the Nephites; and thus he did inspire
      their hearts against the Nephites, insomuch, that in the latter end of the nineteenth year of
      the reign of the Judges, he having accomplished his designs thus far; yea, having been made
      king over the Lamanites, he sought also to reign over all the land; yea, and all the people
      which were in the land; the Nephites as well as the Lamanites; therefore he had accomplished
      his design: for he had hardened the hearts of the Lamanites, and blinded their minds, and
      stirred them up to anger, insomuch that he had gathered together a numerous host, to go to
      battle against the Nephites. For he was determined, because of the greatness of the number of
      his people, to overpower the Nephites, and to bring them into bondage: and thus he did appoint
      Chief Captains of the Zoramites, they being the most acquainted with the strength of the
      Nephites, and their places of resort, and the weakest parts of their cities; therefore he
      appointed them to be Chief Captains over his armies. And it came to pass that they took their
      camp, and moved forth towards the land of Zarahemla, in the wilderness. Now it came to pass
      that while Amalickiah had thus been obtaining power by fraud and deceit, Moroni, on the other
      hand, had been preparing the minds of the people to be faithful unto the Lord their God; yea,
      he had been strengthening the armies of the Nephites, and erecting small forts, or places of
      resort; throwing up banks of earth round about, to enclose his armies, and also building walls
      of stone to encircle them about, round about their cities, and the borders of their lands;
      yea, all round about the land; and in their weakest fortifications, he did place the greater
      number of men; and thus he did fortify and strengthen the land which was possessed by the
      Nephites. And thus he was preparing to support their liberty, their lands, their wives, and
      their children, and their peace, and that they might live unto the Lord their God, and that
      they might maintain that which was called by their enemies the cause of Christians. And Moroni
      was a strong and mighty man; he was a man of a perfect understanding; yea, a man that did not
      delight in bloodshed; a man whose soul did joy in the liberty and the freedom of his country,
      and his brethren from bondage and slavery; yea, a man whose heart did swell with thanksgiving
      to his God, for the many privileges and blessings which he bestowed upon his people; a man who
      did labor exceedingly for the welfare and safety of his people; yea, and he was a man who was
      firm in the faith of Christ, and he had sworn with an oath, to defend his people, his rights,
      and his country, and his religion, even to the loss of his blood. Now the Nephites were taught
      to defend themselves against their enemies, even to the shedding of blood, if it were
      necessary; yea, and they were also taught never to give an offence; yea, and never to raise
      the sword, except it were against an enemy, except it were to preserve their lives: and this
      was their faith, that by so doing. God would prosper them in the land; or in other words, if
      they were faithful in keeping the commandments of God, that he would prosper them in the land;
      yea, warn them to flee, or to prepare for war, according to their danger; and also, that God
      would make it known unto them, whither they should go to defend themselves against their
      enemies; and by so doing, the Lord would deliver them: and this was the faith of Moroni; and
      his heart did glory in it; not in the shedding of blood, but in doing good, in preserving his
      people; yea, in keeping the commandments of God; yea, and resisting iniquity. Yea, verily,
      verily I say unto you, if all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni,
      behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the Devil would never
      have no power over the hearts of the children of men. Behold, he was a man like unto Ammon,
      the son of Mosiah, yea, and even the other sons of Mosiah; yea, and also Alma and his sons:
      for they were all men of God. Now behold, Helaman and his brethren were no less serviceable
      unto the people, then was Moroni; for they did preach the word of God, and they did baptize
      unto repentance, all, men whosoever would hearken unto their words. And thus they went forth,
      and the people did humble themselves because of their words, insomuch that they were highly
      favored of the Lord; and thus they were free from wars and contentions among themselves; yea,
      even for the space of four years. But as I have said in the latter end of the nineteenth; yea,
      notwithstanding their peace amongst themselves, they were compelled reluctantly to contend
      with their brethren, the Lamanites; yea, and in fine, their wars never did cease for the space
      of many years with the Lamanites, notwithstanding their much reluctance. Now they were sorry
      to take up arms against the Lamanites, because they did not delight in the shedding of blood;
      yea, and this was not all; they were sorry to be the means of sending so many of their
      brethren out of this world into an eternal world, unprepared to meet their God; nevertheless,
      they could not suffer to lay down their lives, that their wives and their children should me
      massacred by the barbarous cruelty of those who was once their brethren, yea, and had
      dissented from their church, and had left them, and had gone to destroy them, by joining the
      Lamanites; yea, they could not bear that their brethren should rejoice over the blood of the
      Nephites, so long as there were any who should keep the commandments of God: for the promise
      of the Lord were, If they should keep his commandments, they should prosper in the land.

    <text> And now it came to pass in the eleventh month of the nineteenth year, on the tenth day of
      the month, the armies of the Lamanites were seen approaching towards the land of Ammonihah.
      And behold, the city had been rebuilt, and Moroni had stationed an army by the borders of the
      city, and they had cast up dirt round about to shield them from the arrows and the stones of
      the Lamanites; for behold, they fought with stones, and with arrows. Behold, I said that the
      city of Ammonihah had been rebuilt. I say unto you, yea, that it was in part re-built, and
      because the Lamanites had destroyed it once because of the iniquity of the people, they
      supposed that it would again become an easy prey for them. But behold, how great was their
      disappointment; for behold the Nephites had dug a ridge of earth round about them, which was
      so high that the Lamanites could not cast their stones and their arrows at them, that they
      might take effect; neither could they come upon them, save it was by their place of entrance.
      Now at this time, the Chief Captains of the Lamanites were astonished exceedingly, because of
      the wisdom of the Nephites in preparing their place of security. Now the leaders of the
      Lamanites had supposed, because of the greatness of their numbers; yea, they supposed that
      they should be privileged to come upon them as they had hitherto done; yea, and they had also
      prepared themselves with shields, and with breast-plates; and they had also prepared
      themselves with garments of skins; yea, very thick garments, to cover their nakedness. And
      being thus prepared, they supposed that they should easily overpower and subject their
      brethren to the yoke of bondage, or slay and massacre them according to their pleasure. But
      behold, to their uttermost astonishment, they were prepared for them, in a manner which never
      had been known among all the children of Lehi. Now they were prepared for the Lamanites, to
      battle after the manner of the instructions of Moroni. And it came to pass that the Lamanites,
      or the Amalickiahites, were exceedingly astonished at their manner of preparation for war. Now
      if king Amalickiah had come down out of the land of Nephi, at the head of his army, perhaps he
      would have caused the Lamanites to have attacked the Nephites at the city of Ammonihah; for
      behold, he did care not for the blood of his people. But behold, Amalickiah did not come down
      himself to battle. And behold, his Chief Captains durst not attack the Nephites at the city of
      Ammonihah, for Moroni had altered the management of affairs among the Nephites, insomuch that
      the Lamanites were disappointed in their places of retreat, and they could not come upon them;
      therefore they retreated into the wilderness, and took their camp, and marched towards the
      land of Noah, supposing that to be the next best place for them to come against the Nephites;
      for they knew not that Moroni had fortified or had built forts of security for every city in
      all the land round about; therefore they marched forward to the land of Noah with a firm
      determination; yea, their Chief Captains came forward, and took an oath that they would
      destroy the people of that city. But behold, to their astonishment, the city of Noah, which
      had hitherto been a weak place, had now, by the means of Moroni, became strong; yea, even to
      exceed the strength of the city Ammonihah. And now behold, this was the wisdom in Moroni; for
      he had supposed that they would be frightened at the city of Ammonihah; and as the city of
      Noah had hitherto been the weakest part of the land, therefore they would march thither to
      battle; and thus it was, according to his desires. And behold, Moroni had appointed Lehi to be
      Chief Captain over the men of their city; and it was that same Lehi which fought with the
      Lamanites in the valley, on the east of the river Sidon. And now it came to pass, that when
      the Lamanites had found that Lehi commanded the city, they were again disappointed, for they
      feared Lehi exceedingly; nevertheless, their Chief Captains had sworn with an oath, to attack
      the city; therefore they brought up their armies. Now behold, the Lamanites could not get into
      their forts of security, by any other way save by the entrance, because of the highness of the
      bank which had been thrown up, and the depth of the ditch which had been dug round about, save
      it were by the entrance. And thus were the Nephites prepared to destroy all such as should
      attempt to climb up to enter the fort, by any other way, by casting over stones and arrows at
      them. Thus they were prepared; yea, a body of their most strong men, with their swords and
      their slings, to smite down all who should attempt to come into their place of security, by
      the place of entrance; and thus were they prepared to defend themselves against the Lamanites.
      And it came to pass that the Captains of the Lamanites brought up their armies before the
      place of entrance, and began to contend with the Nephites, to get into their place of
      security; but behold, they were driven back from time to time, insomuch that they were slain,
      with an immense slaughter. Now when they found that they could not obtain power over the
      Nephites by the pass, they began to dig down their banks of earth, that they might obtain a
      pass to their armies, that they might have an equal chance to fight; but behold, in these
      attempts, they were swept off by the stones and the arrows which were thrown at them; and
      instead of filling up their ditches by pulling down the banks of earth, they were filled up in
      a measure, with their dead and wounded bodies. Thus the Nephites had all power over their
      enemies; and thus the Lamanites did attempt to destroy the Nephites, until their Chief
      Captains were all slain; yea, and more than a thousand of the Lamanites were slain; while on
      the other hand, there was not a single soul of the Nephites which were slain. There were about
      fifty which were wounded, which had been exposed to the arrows of the Lamanites through the
      pass; but they were shielded by their shields, and their breast-plates, and their head-plates,
      insomuch that their wounds were upon their legs; many of which were very severe. And it came
      to pass that when the Lamanites saw that their Chief Captains were all slain, they fled into
      the wilderness. And it came to pass that they returned to the land of Nephi, to inform their
      King, Amalickiah, who was a Nephite by birth, concerning their great loss. And it came to pass
      that he was exceeding angry with his people, because he had not obtained his desire over the
      Nephites; he had not subjected them to the yoke of bondage; yea, he was exceeding wroth, and
      he did curse God, and also Moroni, and swearing with an oath that he would drink his blood;
      and this because Moroni had kept the commandments of God in preparing for the safety of his
      people. And it came to pass that on the other hand, the people of Nephi did thank the Lord
      their God, because of his matchless power in delivering them from the hands of their enemies.
      And thus ended the nineteenth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi; yea,
      and there was continual peace among them, and exceeding great prosperity in the church,
      because of their heed and diligence which they gave unto the word of God, which was declared
      unto them by Helaman, and Shiblon, and Corianton, And Ammon, and his brethren, &amp;c.;
      yea, and by all those which had been ordained by the holy order of God, being baptised unto
      repentance, and sent forth to preach among the people, &amp;c. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that Moroni did not stop making preparations for war, or to
      defend themselves against the Lamanites; for he caused that his armies should commence in the
      commencement of the twentieth year of the reign of the Judges, that they should commence in
      digging up heaps of earth round about all the cities, throughout all the land which was
      possessed by the Nephites; and upon the top of these ridges of earth, he caused that there
      should be timbers; yea, works of timbers built up to the height of a man, round about the
      cities. And he caused that upon those works of timbers, that there should be a frame of
      pickets built upon the timbers, round about; and they were strong and high; and he caused
      towers to be erected that overlooked those works of pickets; and he caused places of security
      to be built upon those towers, that the stones and the arrows of the Lamanites could not hurt
      them. And they were prepared, that they could cast stones from the top thereof, according to
      their pleasure and their strength, and slay him which should attempt to approach near the
      walls of the city. Thus Moroni did prepare strong holds against the coming of their enemies,
      round about every city in all the land. And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his armies
      should go forth into the east wilderness; yea, and they went forth, and drove all the
      Lamanites which were in the east wilderness into their own lands, which were south of the land
      of Zarahemla; and the land of Nephi did run in a straight course from the East Sea to the
      West. And it came to pass that when Moroni had driven all the Lamanites out of the east
      wilderness, which was north of the lands of their own possessions, he caused that the
      inhabitants which were in the land of Zarahemla, and in the land round about, should go forth
      into the east wilderness, even to the borders, by the seashore, and possess that land. And he
      also placed armies on the south, in the borders of their possessions, and caused them to erect
      fortifications, that they might secure their armies and their people from the hands of their
      enemies. And thus he cut off all the strong holds of the lamanites, in the east wilderness;
      yea, and also on the west, fortifying the line between the Nephites and the Lamanites, between
      the land of Zarahemla and the land of Nephi; from the West Sea, running by the head of the
      river Sidon; the Nephites possessing all the land northward; yea, even all the land which was
      northward of the land Bountiful, according to their pleasure. Thus Moroni, with his armies,
      which did increase daily, because of the assurance of protection which his works did bring
      forth unto them; therefore they did seek to cut off the strength and the power of the
      Lamanites, from off the lands of their possessions, that they should have no power upon the
      lands of their possession. And it came to pass that the Nephites began the foundation of a
      city; and they called the name of the city Moroni; and it was by the East Sea; and it was on
      the south by the line of the possessions of the Lamanites. And they also began a foundation
      for a city, between the city of Moroni and the city of Aaron, joining the borders of Aaron and
      Moroni; and they called the name of the city, or the land, Nephihah. And they also began, in
      that same year, to build many cities on the north; one in a particular manner, which they
      called Lehi, which was in the north, by the borders of the seashore. And thus ended the
      twentieth year. And in these prosperous circumstances were the people of Nephi, in the
      commencement of the twenty and first year of the reign of the Judges, over the people of
      Nephi. And they did prosper exceedingly, and they became exceeding rich; yea, and they did
      multiply, and were strong in the land. And thus we see how merciful and just are all the
      dealings of the Lord, to the fulfilling of all his words unto the children of men; yea, we can
      behold that his words are verified, even at this time, which he spake unto Lehi, saying:
      Blessed art thou, and thy children; and they shall be blessed, inasmuch as they shall keep my
      commandments; they shall prosper in the land. But remember, inasmuch as they will not keep my
      commandments, they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. And we see that these
      promises have been verified to the people of Nephi; for it has been their quarrelings, and
      their contentions; yea, their murderings, and their plunderings, their idolatry, their
      whoredoms, and their abominations, which were among themselves, which brought upon them their
      wars and destructions. And those who were faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord,
      were delivered at all times, whilst thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to
      bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.
      But behold, there never was a happier time among the people of Nephi, since the days of Nephi,
      than in the days of Moroni; yea, even at this time, in the twenty and first year of the reign
      of Judges. And it came to pass that the twenty and seeond year of the reign of the Judges,
      also ended in peace; yea, and also the twenty and third year. And it came to pass that in the
      commencement of the twenty and fourth year of the reign of the Judges, there would also have
      been peace among the people of Nephi, had it not been for a contention which took place among
      them concerning the land of Lehi, and the land of Morianton, which joined upon the borders of
      Lehi; both of which were on the borders, by the seashore. For behold, the people which
      possessed the land of Morianton, did claim a part of the land of Lehi; therefore there began
      to be a warm contention between them, insomuch that the people of Morianton took up arms
      against their brethren, and they were determined by the sword to slay them. But behold, the
      people which possessed the land of Lehi, fled to the camp of Moroni, and appealed unto him for
      assistance; for behold, they were not in the wrong. And it came to pass that when the people
      of Morianton, which were led by a man whose name was Morianton, found that the people of Lehi
      had fled to the camp of Moroni, they were exceeding fearful, lest the army of Moroni should
      come upon them, and destroy them; therefore, Morianton put it to their hearts that they should
      flee to the land which was northward, which was covered with large bodies of water, and take
      possession of the land which was northward. And behold, they would have carried this plan into
      an effect, (which would have been a cause to have been lamented,)but behold, Morianton, being
      a man of much passion, therefore he was angry with one of his maidservants, and he fell her,
      and beat her much. And it came to pass that she fled, and came over to the camp of Moroni, and
      told Moroni all things concerning the matter; and also concerning their intentions to flee
      into the land northward. Now behold, the people which were in the land Bountiful, or rather
      Moroni, feared that they would hearken to the words of Morianton, and unite with his people,
      and thus he would obtain possession of those parts of the land, which would lay a foundation
      for serious consequences among the people of Nephi; yea, which consequences would lead to the
      overthrow of their liberty; therefore Moroni sent an army, with their camp, to head the people
      of Morianton, to stop their flight into the land northward. And it came to pass that they did
      not head them, until they had come to the borders of the land Desolation; and there they did
      head them, by the narrow pass which led by the sea into the land northward; yea, by the sea,
      on the west, and on the east. And it came to pass that the army which was sent by Moroni,
      which was led by a man whose name was Teancum, did meet the people of Morianton; and so
      stubborn were the people of Morianton, (being inspired by his wickedness and his flattering
      words,) that a battle commenced between them, in which Teancum did slay Morianton, and defeat
      his army, and took them prisoners, and returned to the camp of Moroni. And thus ended the
      twenty and four year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi. And thus was the
      people of Morianton brought back. And upon their covenanting to keep the peace, they were
      restored to the land of Morianton, and a union took place between them and the people of Lehi;
      and they were also restored to their lands. And it came to pass that in the same year that the
      people of Nephi had peace restored unto them, that Nephihah, the second Chief Judge, died,
      having filled the judgment seat with perfect uprightness before God; nevertheless, he had
      refused Alma to take possession of those records and those things which were esteemed by Alma
      and his fathers to be most sacred; therefore Alma had conferred them upon his son Helaman.
      Behold, it came to pass that the son of Nephihah was appointed to fill the judgment seat, in
      the stead of his father; yea, he was appointed Chief Judge, and governor over the people, with
      an oath, and sacred ordinance to judge righteously, and to keep the peace, and freedom of the
      people, and to grant unto them their sacred privileges to worship the Lord their God; yea, to
      support and maintain the cause of God all his days, and to bring the wicked to justice,
      according to their crime. Now behold, his name was Pahoran. And Pahoran did fill the seat of
      his father, and did commence his reign in the end of the twenty and fourth year, over the
      people of Nephi. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass, in the commencement of the twenty and fifth year of the reign of
      the Judges over the people of Nephi, they having established peace between the people of Lehi
      and the people of Morianton concerning their lands, and having commenced the twenty and fifth
      year in peace; nevertheless, they did not long maintain an entire peace in the land for there
      began to be a contention among the people concerning the Chief Judge, Pahoran; for behold,
      there were a part of the people which desired that a few particular points of the law should
      be altered; therefore he did not hearken to those who had sent in their voices with their
      petitions, concerning the altering of the law; therefore those which were desirous that the
      law should be altered, were angry with him, and desired that he should no longer be Chief
      Judge over the land; therefore there arose a warm dispute concerning the matter; but not unto
      bloodshed. And it came to pass that those who were desirous that Pahoran should be dethroned
      from the judgment seat, were called king-men, for they were desirous that the law should be
      altered in a manner to overthrow the free government, and to establish a king over the land.
      And those who were desirous that Pahoran should remain Chief Judge over the land, took upon
      them the name of freemen; and thus was the division among them: for the freemen had sworn or
      covenanted to maintain their rights, and privileges of their religion, by a free government.
      And it came to pass that this matter of their contention was settled, by the voice of the
      people. And it came to pass that the voice of the people came in the favor of the freemen, and
      Pahoran retained the judgment seat, which caused much rejoicing among the brethren of Pahoran,
      and also many of the people of liberty; which also put the king-men to silence, that they
      durst not oppose, but were obliged to maintain the cause of freedom. Now those which were in
      favor of kings, were those of high birth; and they sought to be kings; and they were supported
      by those which sought power and authority over the people. But behold, this was a critical
      time for such contentions to be among the people of Nephi; for behold, Amalickiah had again
      stirred up the hearts of the people of the Lamanites, against the people of the Nephites, and
      he was gathering together soldiers, from all parts of his land, and arming them, and preparing
      for war, with all diligence; for he had sworn to drink the blood of Moroni. But behold, we
      shall see that his promise which he made was rash; nevertheless, he did prepare himself and
      his armies, to come to battle against the Nephites. Now his armies were not so great as they
      had hitherto been, because of the many thousands which had been slain by the hand of the
      Nephites; but notwithstanding their great loss, Amalickiah had gathered together a wonderful
      army, insomuch that he feared not to come down to the land of Zarahemla. Yea, even Amalickiah
      did himself come down, at the head of the Lamanites. And it was in the twenty and fifth year
      of the reign of the Judges; and it was at the same time that they began to settle the affairs
      of their contentions concerning the Chief Judge, Pahoran. And it came to pass that when the
      men which were called king-men, had heard that the Lamanites were coming down to battle
      against them, they were glad in their hearts, and they refused to take up arms; for they were
      so wroth with the Chief Judge, and also with the people of liberty, that they would not take
      up arms to defend their country. And it came to pass that when Moroni saw this, and also saw
      that the Lamanites were coming into the borders of the land, he was exceeding wroth, because
      of the stubborness of those people, of whom he had labored with so much diligence to preserve;
      yea, he was exceeding wroth; his soul was filled with anger against them. And it came to pass
      that he sent a petition, with the voice of the people, unto the Governor of the land, desiring
      that he should read it, and give him, (Moroni,) power to compel those dissenters to defend
      their country, or to put them to death; for it was his first care to put an end to such
      contentions, and dissentions among the people; for behold, this had been hitherto a cause of
      all their destruction. --And it came to pass that it was granted, according to the voice of
      the people. And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that his army should go against those
      king-men, to pull down their pride and their nobility, and level them with the earth, or they
      should take up arms and support the cause of liberty. And it came to pass that the armies did
      march forth against them; and they did pull down their pride and their nobility, insomuch,
      that as they did lift their weapons of war to fight against the men of Moroni, they were hewn
      down, and levelled to the earth. And it came to pass that there were four thousand of those
      dissenters, which were hewn down by the sword; and those of their leaders which were not slain
      in battle, were taken and cast into prison, for there was no time for their trials at this
      period; and the remainder of those dissenters, rather than to be smote down to the earth by
      the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of
      liberty upon their towers, and in their cities, and to take up arms in defence of their
      country. And thus Moroni put an end to those king-men, that there were not any known by the
      appellation of king-men; and thus he put an end to the stubborness, and the pride of those
      people which professed the blood of nobility; but they were brought down to humble themselves
      like unto their brethren, and to fight valiantly for their freedom from bondage. Behold, it
      came to pass that while Moroni was thus breaking down the wars and contentions among his own
      people, and subjecting them to peace and civilization, and making regulations to prepare for
      war against the Lamanites, behold, the Lamanites had come into the land of Moroni, which was
      in the borders by the seashore. And it came to pass that the Nephites were not sufficiently
      strong in the city of Moroni; therefore Amalickiah did drive them slaying many. And it came to
      pass that Amalickiah took possession of the city; yea, possession of all their fortifications.
      And those which fled out of the city of Moroni, came to the city of Nephihah; and also the
      people of Lehi gathered themselves together, and made preparations, and were ready to receive
      the Lamanites to battle. But it came to pass that Amalickiah would not suffer the Lamanites to
      go against the city of Nephihah to battle, but kept them down by the seashore, leaving men in
      every city to maintain and defend it; and thus he went on, taking possession of many cities:
      the city of Nephihah, and the city of Lehi, and the city of Morianton, and the city of Omner,
      and the city of Gid, and the city of Mulek, all of which were on the east borders, by the
      seashore. And thus had the Lamanites obtained, by the cunning of Amalickiah, so many cities,
      by their numberless hosts, all of which were strongly fortified, after the manner of the
      fortifications of Moroni; all of which afforded strong holds for the Lamanites. And it came to
      pass that they marched to the borders of the land Bountiful, driving the Nephites before them,
      and slaying many. But it came to pass that they were met by Teancum, who had slain Morianton,
      and had headed his people in his flight. And it came to pass that he headed Amalickiah also,
      as he was marching forth with his numerous army, that he might take possession of the land
      Bountiful, and also the land northward. But behold, he met with a disappointment, by being
      repulsed by Teancum and his men, for they were great warriors: for every man of Teancum did
      exceed the Lamanites in their strength, and in their skills of war, insomuch they did gain
      advantage over the Lamanites. And it came to pass that they did harrass them, insomuch that
      they did slay them even until it was dark. And it came to pass that Teancum and his men did
      pitch their tents in the borders of the land of Bountiful; and Amalickiah did pitch his tents
      in the borders on the beach by the seashore: and after this manner they were driven. And it
      came to pass that when the night had come, Teancum and his servant stole forth and went out by
      night, and went into the camp of Amalickiah; and behold, sleep had overpowered them, because
      of their much fatigue, which was caused by the labors and the heat of the day. And it came to
      pass that Teancum stole privily into the tent of the king, and put a javelin to his heart; and
      he did cause the death of the king immediately, that he did not awake his servants. And he
      returned again privily to his own camp, and behold, his men were asleep; and he awoke them,
      and told them all the things that he had done. And he caused that his armies should stand in
      readiness, lest the Lamanites had awoke, and should come upon them. And thus ended the twenty
      and fifth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi; and thus ended the days of
      Amalickiah. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass in the twenty and sixth year of the reign of the Judges over the
      people of Nephi, behold, when the Lamanites awoke on the first morning of the first month,
      behold, they found Amalickiah was dead, in his own tent; and they also saw that Teancum was
      ready to give them battle on that day. And now when the Lamanites saw this, they were
      affrighted; and they abandoned their design in marching into the land northward, and retreated
      with all their army into the city of Mulek, and sought protection in their fortifications,
      --And it came to pass that the brother of Amalickiah was appointed king over the people; and
      his name was Ammoron: thus king Ammoron, the brother of king Amalickiah, was appointed to
      reign in his stead. And it came to pass that he did command that his people should maintain
      those cities which they had taken by the shedding of blood; for they had not taken any cities,
      save they had lost much blood. And now Teancum saw that the Lamanites were determined to
      maintain those cities which they had taken, and those parts of the land which they had
      obtained possession of; and also seeing the enormity of their number, Teancum thought it was
      not expedient that he should attempt to attack them in their forts; but he kept his men round
      about, as if making preparations for war; yea, and truly he was preparing to defend himself
      against them, by casting up walls round about, and preparing places of resort. And it came to
      pass that he kept thus preparing for war, until Moroni had sent a large number of men to
      strengthen his army; and Moroni also sent orders unto him, that he should retain all the
      prisoners which fell into his hands; for as the Lamanites had taken many prisoners, that he
      should retain all the prisoners of the Lamanites, as a ransom for those which the Lamanites
      had taken. And he also sent orders unto him, that he should fortify the land Bountiful, and
      secure the narrow pass which led into the land northward, lest the Lamanites should obtain
      that point, and should have power to harrass them on every side. And Moroni also sent unto
      him, desiring that he would be faithful in maintaining that quarter of the land, and that he
      would seek every opportunity to scourge the Lamanites in that quarter, as much as was his
      power, that perhaps he might take again, by stratagem or some other way, those cities which
      had been taken out of their hands; and that he also would fortify and strengthen the cities
      round about, which had not fallen into the hands of the Lamanites. And he also said unto him,
      I would come unto you, but behold, the Lamanites are upon us in the borders of the land by the
      West Sea; and behold, I go against them, therefore I cannot come unto you. Now the king
      (Ammoron,) had departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and had made known unto the queen
      concerning the death of his brother, and had gathered together a large number of men, and had
      marched forth against the Nephites, on the borders of the West Sea; and thus he was
      endeavoring to harrass the Nephites, and to draw away a part of their forces to that part of
      the land, while he had commanded those which he had left to possess the cities which he had
      taken, that they should also harrass the Nephites on the borders by the East Sea; and should
      take possession of their lands as much as it were in their power, according to the power of
      their armies. And thus were the Nephites in those dangerous circumstances, in the ending of
      the twenty and sixth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi. But behold, it
      came to pass in the twenty and seventh year of the reign of the Judges, that Teancum, by the
      command of Moroni, who had established armies to protect the south and the west borders of the
      land, had began his march towards the land Bountiful, that he might assist Teancum with his
      men, in retaking the cities which they had lost. And it came to pass that Teancum had received
      orders to make an attack upon the city of Mulek, and retake it if it were possible. And it
      came to pass that Teancum made preparations to make an attack upon the city of Mulek, and
      march forth with his army against the Lamanites; but he saw that it was impossible that he
      could overpower them while they were in their fortifications; therefore he abandoned his
      designs, and returned again to the city Bountiful, to wait for the coming of Moroni, that he
      might receive strength to his army. And it came to pass that Moroni did arrive with his army
      to the land of Bountiful, in the latter end of the twenty and seventh year of the reign of the
      Judges over the people of Nephi. And in the commencement of the twenty and eighth year, Moroni
      and Teancum, and many of the Chief Captains, held a council of war, what they should do to
      cause the Lamanites to come out against them to battle; or that they might by some means,
      flatter them out of their strong holds, that they might gain advantage over them, and take
      again the city of Mulek. And it came to pass that they sent embassies to the army of the
      Lamanites, which protected the city of Mulek, to their leader, whose name was Jacob, desiring
      him that he would come out with his armies to meet them upon the plains, between the two
      cities. But behold, Jacob, which was a Zoramite, would not come out with his army to meet them
      upon the plains. And it came to pass that Moroni, having no hopes of meeting them upon fair
      grounds, therefore he resolved upon a plan that he might decoy the Lamanites out of their
      strong holds. Therefore he caused that Teancum should take a small number of men, and march
      down near the seashore; and Moroni and his army, by night, marched into the wilderness, on the
      west of the city of Mulek; and thus, on the morrow, when the guards of the Lamanites had
      discovered Teancum, they ran and told it unto Jacob, their leader. And it came to pass that
      the armies of the Lamanites did march forth against Teancum, supposing by their numbers to
      overpower Teancum, because of the smallness of his numbers. And as Teancum saw the armies of
      the Lamanites coming out against him, he began to retreat down by the seashore, northward. And
      it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that he began to flee, they took courage and
      pursued them with vigor. And while Teancum was thus leading away the Lamanites which were
      pursuing them in vain, behold, Moroni commanded that a part of his army which were with him,
      should march forth into the city, and take possession of it. And thus they did, and slew all
      those who had been left to protect the city; yea, all those who would not yield up their
      weapons of war. And thus Moroni had obtained a possession of the city of Mulek, with a part of
      his army, while he marched with the remainder to meet the Lamanites, when they should return
      from the pursuit of Teancum. And it came to pass that the Lamanites did pursue Teancum until
      they came near the city Bountiful, and then they were met by Lehi, and a small army, which had
      been left to protect the city Bountiful. And now Behold, when the Chief Captains of the
      Lamanites had beheld Lehi, with his army, coming against them, they fled in much confusion,
      lest perhaps they should not obtain the city Mulek, before Lehi should overtake them; for they
      were wearied because of their march; and the men of Lehi were fresh. Now the Lamanites did not
      know that Moroni had been in their rear with his army; and all they feared, was Lehi and his
      men. Now Lehi was not desirous to overtake them, till they should meet Moroni and his army.
      And it came to pass that before the Lamanites had retreated far, they were surrounded by the
      Nephites; by the men of Moroni on one hand, and the men of Lehi on the other, all of whom were
      fresh and full of strength; but the Lamanites were wearied, because of their long march. And
      Moroni commanded his men that they should fall upon them, until they had given up their
      weapons of war. And it came to pass that Jacob, being their leader, being also a Zoramite, and
      having an unconquerable spirit, he led the Lamanites forth to battle, with exceeding fury
      against Moroni. Moroni being in their course of march, therefore Jacob was determined to slay
      them, and cut his way through to the city of Mulek. But behold, Moroni and his men were more
      powerful; therefore they did not give away before the Lamanites. And it came to pass that they
      fought on both hands with exceeding fury; and there were many slain on both sides; yea, and
      Moroni was wounded, and Jacob was killed. And Lehi pressed upon their rear with such fury,
      with his strong man, that the Lamanites in the rear delivered up their weapons of war; and the
      remainder of them, being much confused, knew not whether to go or to strike. Now Moroni seeing
      their confusion, he said unto them, if ye will bring forth your weapons of war, and deliver
      them up, behold we will forbear shedding your blood. And it came to pass that when the
      Lamanites had heard these words, their Chief Captains, all those which were not slain, came
      forth and threw down their weapons of war at the feet of Moroni, and also commanded their men
      that they should do the same; but behold, there were many that would not; and those who would
      not deliver up their swords, were taken and bound, and their weapons of war were taken from
      them, and they were compelled to march with their brethren forth into the land Bountiful. And
      now the number of prisoners which were taken, exceeded more than the number of those which had
      been slain; yea, more than those which had been slain on both sides. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that they did set guards over the prisoners of the Lamanites, and did
      compel them to go forth and bury their dead; yea, and also the dead of the Nephites which were
      slain; and Moroni placed men over them to guard them while they should perform their labors.
      And Moroni went to the city of Mulek with Lehi, and took command of the city, and gave it unto
      Lehi. Now behold this Lehi was a man who had been with Moroni in the more part of all his
      battles; and he was a man like unto Moroni; and they rejoiced in each other's safety; yea,
      they were beloved by each other, and also beloved by all the people of Nephi. And it came to
      pass that after the Lamanites had finished burying their dead, and also the dead of the
      Nephites, they were marched back into the land Bountiful; and Teancum, by the orders of
      Moroni, caused that they should commence in laboring in digging a ditch round about the land,
      or the city Bountiful; and he caused that they should build a breastwork of timbers upon the
      inner bank of the ditch; and they cast up dirt out of the ditch against the breastwork of
      timbers; and thus they did cause the Lamanites to labor, until they had encircled the city of
      Bountiful round about with a strong wall of timbers and earth, to an exceeding height. And
      this city became an exceeding strong hold ever after; and in this city they did guard the
      prisoners of the Lamanites; yea, even within a wall, which they had caused them to build with
      their own hands. Now Moroni was compelled to cause the Lamanites to labor, because it were
      easy to guard them while at their labor; and he desired all his forces, when he should make an
      attack upon the Lamanites. And it came to pass that Moroni had thus gained a victory over one
      of the greatest of the armies of the Lamanites, and had obtained possession of the city of
      Mulek, which was one of the strongest hold of the Lamanites in the land of Nephi; and thus he
      had built a strong hold to retain his prisoners. And it came to pass that he did no more
      attempt a battle with the Lamanites in that year, but he did employ his men in preparing for
      war; yea, and in making fortifications to guard against the Lamanites; yea, and also
      delivering their women and their children from famine and affliction, and providing food for
      their armies. And now it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites, on the West Sea,
      south, while in the absence of Moroni, on account of some intrigue amongst the Nephites, which
      caused dissensions amongst them, had gained some ground over the Nephites, yea, insomuch that
      they obtained possession of a number of their cities in that part of the land; and thus
      because of iniquity amongst themselves, yea, because of dissensions and intrigue among
      themselves, they were placed in the most dangerous circumstances. And now behold, I have
      somewhat to say concerning the people of Ammon, which, in the beginning, were Lamanites; but
      by Ammon and his brethren, or rather by the power and word of god, they had been converted
      unto the Lord; and they had been brought down into the land of Zarahemla, and had ever since
      been protected by the Nephites; and because of their oath, they had been kept from taking up
      arms against their brethren; for they had an oath, that they never would shed blood more; and
      according to their oath, they would have perished; yea, they would have suffered themselves to
      have fallen into the hands of their brethren, had it not been for the pity and the exceeding
      love which Ammon and his brethren had had for them; and for this cause, they were brought down
      into the land of Zarahemla; and they ever had been protected by the Nephites. But it came to
      pass that when they saw the danger, and the many afflictions and tribulations which the
      Nephites bore for them, they were moved with compassion, and were desirous to take up arms in
      the defence of their country. But behold, as they were about to take their weapons of war,
      they were overpowered by the persuasions of Helaman and his brethren, for they were about to
      break the oath which they had made; and Helaman feared lest by so doing, they should lose
      their souls; therefore all those which had entered into this covenant, were compelled to
      behold their brethren wade through their afflictions, in their dangerous circumstances, at
      this time. But behold, it came to pass they had many sons, which had not entered into a
      covenant that they would not take their weapons of war to defend themselves against their
      enemies; therefore they did assemble themselves together at this time, as many as were able to
      take up arms; and they called themselves Nephites; and they entered into a covenant, to fight
      for there liberty of the Nephites; yea, to protect the land unto the laying down of their
      lives; yea, even they covenanted that they never would give up their liberty, but they would
      fight in all cases to protect the Nephites and themselves from bondage. Now behold, there were
      two thousand of those young men which entered into this covenant, and took their weapons of
      war to defend their country. And now behold, as they never had hitherto been a disadvantage of
      the Nephites, they became now at this period of time also a great support; for they took their
      weapons of war, and they would that Helaman should be their leader. And they were all young
      men, and they were exceeding valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity; but
      behold, this was not all: they were men which were true at all times in whatsoever thing they
      were entrusted; yea, they were men of truth and soberness, for they had been taught to keep
      the commandments of God, and walk uprightly before him. And now it came to pass that Helaman
      did march at the head of his two thousand stripling soldiers, to the support of the people in
      the borders of the land on the south, by the West Sea. And thus ended the twenty and eigth
      year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi, &amp;c. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass in the twenty and ninth year of the reign of the Judges, that
      Ammoron sent unto Moroni, desiring that he would exchange prisoners. And it came to pass that
      Moroni felt to rejoice exceedingly at this request, for he desired the provisions which was
      imparted for the support of the Lamanite prisoners, for the support of his own people; and he
      also desired his own people for the strengthening of his army. --Now the Lamanites had taken
      many women and children; and there was not a woman nor a child among all the prisoners of
      Moroni, or the prisoners which Moroni had taken; therefore Moroni resolved upon a stratagem,
      to obtain as many prisoners of the Nephites from the Lamanites, as it were possible; therefore
      he wrote and epistle, and sent it by the servant of Ammoron, the same who had brought an
      epistle to Moroni. Now these are the words which he wrote unto Ammoron, saying: Behold,
      Ammoron, I have wrote unto you somewhat concerning this war which we have waged against my
      people, or rather which thy brother hath waged against them, and which ye are still determined
      to carry on after his death. Behold, I would tell you something concerning the justice of God,
      and the sword of his Almighty wrath, which doth hang over you: Except ye repent and withdraw
      your armies into your own lands, or the lands of your possessions, which is the land of Nephi;
      yea, I would tell you these things, if ye were capable of hearkening unto them; yea, I would
      tell you concerning that awful hell that awaits to receive such murderers as thou and thy
      brother hath been, except ye repent and withdraw your murderous purposes, and return with your
      armies to your own lands; but as ye have rejected these things, and have fought against the
      people of the Lord. even so I may expect you will do it again. And now behold, we are prepared
      to receive you; yea, and except you withdraw your purposes, behold, ye will pull down the
      wrath of that God whom you have rejected, upon you, even to your utter destruction; but as the
      Lord liveth, our armies shall come upon you, except ye withdraw, and ye shall soon be visited
      with death, for we will retain our cities and our lands; yea, and we will maintain our
      religion and the cause of our God. But behold, it supposeth me that I talk to you concerning
      these things in vain; or it supposeth me that that thou art a child of hell; therefore I will
      close my epistle, by telling you that I will not exchange prisoners, save it be on conditions
      that ye will deliver up a man, and his wife, and his children, for one prisoner; if this be
      the case that ye will do it, I will exchange. And behold, if ye do not do this, I will come
      against you with my armies; yea, even I will arm my women and my children, and I will come
      against you, and I will follow you even into your own land, which is the land of our first
      inheritance; yea, and it shall be blood for blood; yea, life for life; and I will give you
      battle, even until you are destroyed from off the face of the earth. Behold, I am in my anger,
      and also my people; ye have sought to murder us, and we have only sought to defend ourselves.
      But behold, if ye seek to destroy us more, we will seek to destroy you; yea, and we will seek
      our land, the lands of our first inheritance. Now I close my epistle. I am Moroni; I am a
      leader of the people of the Nephites. Now it came to pass that Ammoron, when he had received
      this epistle, he was angry, and he wrote another epistle unto Moroni; and these are the words
      which he wrote, saying: I am Ammoron, the king of the Lamanites; I am the brother of
      Amalickiah, whom ye have murdered. Behold, I will avenge his blood upon you; yea, And I will
      come upon you with my armies, for I fear not your threatnings. For behold, your fathers did
      wrong their brethren, insomuch that they did rob them of their right to the government, when
      it rightly belonged unto them. And now behold, if ye will lay down pour arms, and subject
      yourselves to be governed by those whom the government doth rightly belong, then will I cause
      that my people shall lay down their weapons, and shall be at war no more. Behold, ye have
      breathed out many threatnings against me and my people; but behold, we fear not your
      threatnings; nevertheless, I will grant to exchange prisoners according to your request,
      gladly, that I may preserve my food for my men of war; and we will wage a war which shall be
      eternal, either to subjecting the Nephites to our authority, or to their eternal extinction.
      And concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being;
      neither do ye; but if it so be that there is such a being, we know not but that he hath made
      us as well as you; and if it so be that there is a Devil and a hell, behold, will he not send
      you there, to dwell with my brother, which ye have murdered, which ye have hinted that he hath
      gone to such a place?. But behold, these things mattereth not. I am Ammoron, and a descendant
      of Zoram, whom your fathers pressed and brought out of Jerusalem. And behold, now, I am a bold
      Lamanite. Behold, this war has been waged, to avenge their wrongs, and to maintain, and to
      obtain their rights to the government; and I close my epistle to Moroni. </text>

    <text> Now it came to pass that when Moroni received this epistle, he was more angry, because he
      knew that Ammoron had a perfect knowledge of his fraud; yea, he knew that Ammoron knew that it
      was not a just cause that had caused him to wage war against the people of Nephi. And he said,
      Behold, I will not exchange prisoners with Ammoron, save he will withdraw his purpose, as I
      have stated in my epistle; for I will not grant unto him that he shall have any more power
      than what he hath got. Behold, I know the place where the Lamanites doth guard my people,
      which they have taken prisoners; and as Ammoron would not grant unto me mine epistle, behold,
      I will give unto him according to my words; yea, I will seek death among them, until they
      shall sue for peace. And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words, he caused
      that a search should be made among his men, that perhaps he might find a man which was a
      descendant of Laman among them. And it came to pass that they found one, whose name was Laman;
      and he was one of the servants of the king which was murdered by Amalickiah. Now Moroni caused
      that Laman and a small number of his men, should go forth unto the guard which were over the
      Nephites. Now the Nephites were guarded in the city of Gid; therefore Moroni caused that Laman
      and a small number of men which was appointed to go with him. And it came to pass that when it
      was evening, Laman went to the guards which were over the Nephites, and behold, they saw him
      coming, and they hailed him. But he saith unto them, Fear not. Behold, I am a Lamanite.
      Behold, we have escaped from the Nephites, and they sleepeth; and behold, we have took of
      their wine, and brought with us. Now when the Lamanites heard these words, they received him
      with joy. --And they said unto him, Give us of your wine, that we may drink; we are glad that
      ye have thus taken wine with you, for we are weary. But Laman saith unto them, Let us keep of
      our wine till we go against the Nephites to battle. But this saying only made them more
      desirous to drink of the wine. --For, said they, We are weary; therefore let us take of the
      wine, and by and by we shall receive wine for our rations, which will strengthen us to go
      against the Nephites. And Laman saith unto them, You may do according to your desires. And it
      came to pass that they did take of the wine freely, and it was pleasant to their taste;
      therefore they took of it more freely; and it was strong, having been prepared in its
      strength. And it came to pass they did drink and were merry, and by and by they were all
      drunken. Now when Laman and his men saw that they were all drunken, and were in a deep sleep,
      they returned to Moroni, and told him all the things that had happened. And now this was
      according to the design of Moroni. And Moroni had prepared his men with weapons of war; and he
      went to the city of Gid, while the Lamanites were in a deep sleep, and drunken, and cast in
      the weapons of war in unto the prisoners, insomuch that they were all armed; yea, even to
      their women, and all those of their children, as many as were able to use a weapon of war;
      when Moroni had armed all those prisoners. And all those things were done in a profound
      silence . But had they awoke the Lamanites, behold they were drunken, and the Nephites could
      have slain them. But behold this was not the desire of Moroni. He did not delight in murder or
      bloodshed; but he delighted in the saving of his people from destruction; and for this cause
      he might not bring upon him injustice, he would not fall upon the Lamanites and destroy them
      in their drunkennes. But he had obtained his desires; for he had armed those prisoners of the
      Nephites which were within the wall of the city, and had gave them power to gain possession of
      those parts which were within the walls; and then he caused the men which were with him, to
      withdraw a pace from them, and surround the armies of the Lamanites. Now behold, this was done
      in the night time, so that when the Lamanites awoke in the morning, they beheld that they were
      surrounded by the Nephites without, and that their prisoners were armed within. And thus they
      saw that the Nephites had power over them; and in these circumstances they found it was not
      expedient that they should fight with the Nephites; therefore their Chief Captains demanded
      their weapons of war, and they brought them forth, and cast them at the feet of the Nephites,
      pleading for mercy. Now behold, this was the desire of Moroni. He took them prisoners of war,
      and took possession of the city, and caused that all prisoners should be liberated, which were
      Nephites; and they did join the army of Moroni, and were a great strength to his army. And it
      came to pass that he did cause the Lamanites which he had taken prisoners, that they should
      commence a labor in strengthening the fortifications round about the city of Gid. And it came
      to pass that when he had fortified the city of Gid, according to his desires, he caused that
      his prisoners be taken to the city Bountiful. And he also guarded that city with an exceeding
      strong force. And it came to pass that they did, notwithstanding all the intrigues of the
      Lamanites, keep and protect all the prisoners which they had taken, and also maintain all the
      ground and the advantage which they had retaken. And it came to pass that the Nephites began
      again to be victorious, and to reclaim their rights and privileges. Many time did the
      Lamanites attempt to encircle them about by night, but these attempts they did lose many
      prisoners. --And many times did they atempt to administer of their wine to the Nephites, that
      they might destroy them with poison or with drunkenness. But behold, the Nephites were not
      slow to remember the Lord their God, in this their times of affliction. They could not be
      taken in their snares; yea, they would not partake of their wine; yea, they would not take of
      wine, save they had firstly given to some of the Lamanite prisoners. And they were thus
      cautious, that no poison should be administered among them; for if their wine would poison a
      Lamanite, it would also poison a Nephite; and thus they did try all their liquors. And now it
      came to pass that it was expedient for Moroni to make preparations to attack the city of
      Morianton. --For behold, the Lamanites had, by their labors, fortified the city of Morionton
      until it had become an exceeding strong hold; and they were continually bringing new forces
      into that city, and also new supplies of provisions. And thus ended the twenty and ninth year
      of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass in the commencement of the thirtieth year of the reign of the
      Judges, in the second day, on the first month, Moroni received an epistle from Helaman,
      stating the affairs of the people in that quarter of the land. And these are the words which
      he wrote, saying: My dearly beloved brother, Moroni, as well in the Lord as in the
      tribulations of our warfare; behold, my beloved brother, I have somewhat to tell you
      concerning our warfare in this part of the land. Behold, two thousand of the sons of those men
      which Ammon brought down out of the land of Nephi: Now ye have known that these were a
      descendant of Laman, which was the eldest son of our father Lehi. Now I need not rehearse unto
      you concerning their traditions or their unbelief, for thou knowest concerning all these
      things; therefore it supposeth me that I tell you that two thousand of these young men hath
      taken their weapons of war, and would that I should be their leader; and we have come forth to
      defend our country. And now ye also know concerning the covenant which their fathers made,
      that they would not take up their weapons of war against their brethren, to shed blood. But in
      the twenty and sixth year, when they saw our afflictions and our tribulations for them, they
      were about to break the covenant which they had made, and take up their weapons of war in our
      defence. But I would not suffer them that they should break this covenant which they had made,
      supposing that God would strengthen us, insomuch that we would not suffer more because of the
      fulfilling the oath which they had taken. But behold, here is one thing in which we may have
      great joy. For behold, in the twenty and sixth year, I Helaman, did march at the head of these
      two thousand young men, to the city of Judea, to assist Antipus, whom ye had appointed a
      leader over the people of that part of the land. And I did join my two thousand sons, (for
      they are worthy to be called sons,) to the army of Antipus; in the which strength Antipus did
      rejoice exceedingly; for behold, his army had been reduced by the Lamanites because of the
      numerority of their forces having slain a vast number of our men; for which cause we have to
      mourn. Nevertheless, we may console ourselves in this point: that they have died in the cause
      of their country and of their God; yea, and they are happy. And the Lamanites had also
      retained many prisoners, all of whom are Chief Captains; for none other have they spared
      alive. And we suppose that they are now at this time in the land of Nephi; it is so if they
      are not slain. And now these are the cities which the Lamanites have obtained possession, by
      the shedding of the blood of so many of our valiant men: The land of Manti, or the city of
      Manti, and the city of Zeezrom, and the city of Cumeni, and the city of Antiparah. And these
      are the cities which they possessed when I arrived at the city of Judea; and I found Antipus
      and his men toiling with their mights to fortify the city; yea, and they were depressed in
      body as well as in spirit; for they had fought valiantly by day, and toiled by night, to
      maintain their cities; and thus they had suffered great afflictions of every kind. And now
      they were determined to conquer in this place, or die; therefore you may well suppose that
      this little force which I brought with me; yea, those sons of mine, gave them great hopes and
      much joy. And now it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that Antipus had received a
      greater strength to his army, they were compelled by the orders of Ammoron, to not come
      against the city of Judea, or against us, to battle. And thus were we favored of the Lord: for
      had they come upon us in this our weakness, they might have perhaps destroyed our little army;
      but thus were we preserved. They were commanded by Ammoron to maintain those cities which they
      had taken. And thus ended the twenty and sixth year. And in the commencement of the twenty and
      seventh year, we had prepared our city and ourselves for defence. Now we were desirous that
      the Lamanites should come upon us; for we were not desirous to make an attack upon them in
      their strong holds. And it came to pass that we kept spies round about, to watch the movements
      of the Lamanites, that they might not pass us by night, nor by day, to make an attack upon our
      other cities, which were on the northward; for we knew in those cities they were not
      sufficiently strong to meet them; therefore we were desirous, if they should pass by us, to
      fall upon them in their rear, and thus bring them up in the rear, at the same time they were
      met in the front. We supposed that we could overpower them; but behold, we were disappointed
      in this our desire. They durst not pass by us with their whole army; neither durst they with a
      part, lest they should not be sufficiently strong, and they should fall. Neither durst they
      march down against the city of Zarahemla; neither durst they cross the head of Sidon, over the
      city of Nephihah. And thus, with their forces, they were determined to maintain those cities
      which they had taken. And now it came to pass in the second month of this year, there was
      brought unto us many provisions, from the fathers of those two thousand sons, And also there
      was sent two thousand men unto us, from the land of Zarahemla. And thus we were prepared with
      ten thousand men, and provisions for them, and also for their wives, and their children. And
      the Lamanites, thus seeing our forces increase daily, and provisions arrive for our support,
      they began to be fearful, and began to sally forth, if it were possible, to put an end to our
      receiving provisions and strength. Now when we saw that the Lamanites began to grow uneasy on
      this wise, we were desirous to bring a stratagem into an effect upon them; therefore Antipus
      ordered that I should march forth with my little sons, to a neighboring city, as if they were
      carrying provisions to a neighboring city. And we were to march near the city Antiparah, as if
      we were going to the city beyond, in the borders, by the seashore. And it came to pass that we
      did march forth, as if with our provisions, to go to the city. And it came to pass that
      Antipus did march forth, with a part of his army, leaving the remainder to maintain the city.
      But he did not march forth, until I had gone forth with my little army, and came near the city
      Antiparah. And now in the city of Antiparah, were stationed the strongest army of the
      Lamanites; yea, the most numerous. And it came to pass that when they had been informed by
      their spies, they came forth with their army, and marched against us. And it came to pass that
      we did flee before them, northward. And thus we did lead away the most powerful army of the
      Lamanites; yea, even to a considerable distance, insomuch that when they saw the army of
      Antipus pursuing them, with their mights, they did not turn to the right nor to the left, but
      pursued their march in a straight course after us; and, as we supposed, it was their intent to
      slay us before Antipus should overtake them, and this that they might not be surrounded by our
      people. And now Antipus, beholding our danger, did speed the march of his army. But behold, it
      was night; therefore they did not overtake us, neither did Antipus overtake them; therefore we
      did camp for the night. And it came to pass that before the dawn of the morning behold, the
      Lamanites were pursuing us. Now we were not sufficiently strong to contend with them, yea, I
      would not suffer that my little sons should fall into their hands; therefore we did continue
      our march; and we took our march into the wilderness. Now they durst not turn to the right nor
      to the left, lest they should be surrounded; neither would I turn to the right or to the left,
      lest they should overtake me, and we could not stand against them, but be slain, and they
      would make their escape; and thus we did flee all that day into the wilderness, even until it
      was dark. And it came to pass that again when the light of the morning came, we saw the
      Lamanites upon us, and we did flee before them. But it came to pass that they did not pursue
      us far, before they halted; and it was in the morning of the third day, on the seventh month.
      And now whether they were overtaken by Antipus, we knew not; but I said unto my men, Behold,
      we know not but they have halted for the purpose that we should come against them, that they
      might catch us in their snare; therefore, what say ye, my sons, will ye go against them to
      battle?. And now I say unto you, my beloved brother Moroni, That never had I seen so great
      courage, nay, not amongst all the Nephites. For as I had ever called them my sons,(for they
      were all of them very young,) even so they said unto me, Father, behold, our God is with us,
      and he will not suffer that we shall fall; then let us go forth; we would not slay our
      brethren, if they would let us alone; therefore let us go, lest they should overpower the army
      of Antipus. Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did think more
      upon the liberty of their fathers, than they did upon their lives; yea, they had been taught
      by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, that God would deliver them. And they rehearsed
      unto me the words of their mothers, saying: We do not doubt our mothers knew it. And it came
      to pass that I did return with my two thousand, against these Lamanites which had pursued us.
      And now behold, the armies of Antipus had overtaken them, and a terrible battle had commenced.
      The army of Antipus being weary, because of their long march in so short a space of time, were
      about to fall into the hands of the Lamanites; and had I not returned with my two thousand,
      they would have obtained their purpose: for Antipus had fallen by the sword, and many of his
      leaders, because of their weariness, which was occasioned by the speed of their march;
      therefore the men of Antipus being confused, because of the fall of their leaders began to
      give way before the Lamanites. And it came to pass that the Lamanites took courage, and began
      to pursue them; and thus were the Lamanites pursuing them with great vigor, when Helaman came
      upon their rear with his two thousand, and began to slay them, exceedingly, insomuch that the
      whole army of the Lamanites halted, and turned on Helaman. Now when the people of Antipus saw
      that the Lamanites had turned them about, they gathered together their men, and came again
      upon the rear of the Lamanites. And now it came to pass that we, the people of Nephi, the
      people of Antipus, and I with my two thousand, did surround the Lamanites, and did slay them;
      yea, insomuch that they were compelled to deliver up their weapons of war, and also themselves
      as prisoners of war. And now it came to pass that when they surrendered themselves up unto us,
      behold, I numbered those young men which had fought with me, fearing lest there were many of
      them slain. But behold, to my great joy, there had not one soul of them fallen to the earth;
      yea, and they had fought as if with the strength of God; yea, never was men known to have
      fought with such miraculous strength; and with such mighty power did they fall upon the
      Lamanites, that they did frighten them; and for this cause did the Lamanites deliver
      themselves up as prisoners of war. And as we had no place for our prisoners, that we could
      guard them to keep them from the armies of the Lamanites, therefore we sent them to the land
      of Zarahemla, and a part of those men which were not slain of Antipus, with them; and the
      remainder I took and joined them to my stripling Ammonites, and took our march back to the
      city of Judea. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that I received an epistle from Ammoron, the king, stating that
      if I would deliver up those prisoners of war which we had taken, that he would deliver up the
      city of Antiparah unto us. But I sent an epistle unto the king, That we were sure our forces
      were sufficient to take the city of Antiparah by our force; and by delivering up the prisoners
      for that city, we should suppose ourselves unwise, and that we would only deliver up our
      prisoners on exchange. And Ammoron refused mine epistle, for he would not exchange prisoners;
      therefore we began to make preparations to go against the city of Antiparah. But the people of
      Antiparah did leave the city, and fled to their other cities which they had possession of, to
      fortify them; and thus the city of Antiparah fell into our hands. And thus ended the twenty
      and eighth year of the reign of the Judges. And it came to pass that in the commencement of
      the twenty and ninth year, we received a supply of provisions, and also an addition to our
      army, from the land of Zarahemla, and from the land round about, to the number of six thousand
      men, besides sixty of the sons of the Ammonites, which had come to join their brethren, my
      little band of two thousand. And now behold, we were strong; yea, and we had also a plenty of
      provisions brought unto us. And it came to pass that it was our desire to wage a battle with
      the army which was placed to protect the city Cumeni. And now behold, I will shew unto you
      that we soon accomplished our desire; yea, with our strong force, or with a part of our strong
      force, we did surround, by night, the city Cumeni, a little before they were to receive a
      supply of provisions. And it came to pass that we did camp round about the city for many
      nights; but we did sleep upon our swords, and keep guards that the Lamanites could not come
      upon us by night, and slay us, which they attempted many times; but as many times as they
      attempted this, their blood was spilt. At length their provisions did arrive, and they were
      about to enter the city by night. And we, instead of being Lamanites, were Nephites;
      therefore, we did take them and their provisions. --And not withstanding the Lamanites being
      cut off from their support after this manner, they were still determined to maintain the city;
      therefore it became expedient that we should take those provisions and send them to Judea and
      our prisoners to the land of Zarahemla. And it came to pass that not many days had passed
      away, before the Lamanites began to lose all hopes of succor; therefore they yielded up the
      city into our hands; and thus we had accomplished our designs, in obtaining the city Cumeni.
      But it came to pass that our prisoners were so numerous, that notwithstanding the enormity of
      our numbers, we were obliged to employ all our force to keep them, or to put them to death.
      For behold, they would break out in great numbers, and would fight with stones, and with
      clubs, or whatsoever things they could get into their hands, insomuch that we did slay upwards
      of two thousand of them, after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war; therefore it
      became expedient for us, that we should put an end to their lives, or guard them, sword in
      hand, down to the land of Zarahemla; and also our provisions were not any more sufficient for
      our own people, notwithstanding that which we had taken from the Lamanites. And now, in those
      critical circumstances, it became a very serious matter to determine concerning these
      prisoners of war; nevertheless, we did resolve to send them down to the land of Zarahemla;
      therefore we selected a part of our men, and gave them charge over our prisoners, to go down
      to the land of Zarahemla. But it came to pass that on the morrow, they did return. --And now
      behold, we did not inquire of them concerning the prisoners; for behold, the Lamanites were
      upon us, and they returned in season to save us from falling into their lands. --For behold,
      Ammon had sent to their support a new supply of provisions, and also a numerous army of men.
      And it came to pass that those men which we sent with the prisoners, did arrive in season to
      check them, as they were about to overpower us. But behold, my little band of two thousand and
      sixty, fought most desperately; yea, they were firm before the Lamanites, and did administer
      death unto all those who opposed them; and as the remainder of our army were about to give way
      before the Lamanites, behold, those two thousand and sixty were firm and undaunted; yea, and
      they did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness; yea, and even
      according to their faith, it was done unto them; and I did remember the words which they said
      unto me that their mothers had taught them. And now behold, it was these, my sons, and those
      men which had been selected to convey the prisoners, to whom we owe this great victory; for it
      was they who did beat the Lamanites; therefore they were driven back to the city of Manti. And
      we retained our city Cumeni, and were not all destroyed by the sword; nevertheless, we had
      suffered great loss. And it came to pass that after the Lamanites had fled, I immediately gave
      orders that my men which had been wounded, should be taken from among the dead, and caused
      that their wounds should be dressed. And it came to pass that there were two hundred, out of
      my two thousand and sixty, which had fainted because of the loss of blood; nevertheless,
      according to the goodness of God, and to our great astonishment, and also the foes of our
      whole army, there was not one soul of them which did perish; yea, and neither was there one
      soul among them which had not received many wounds. And now, their preservation was
      astonishing to our whole army; yea, that they should be spared, while there was a thousand of
      our brethren which were slain. And we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous power of God,
      because of their exceeding faith in that which they had been taught to believe, that there was
      a just God; and whosoever did not doubt, that they should be preserved by his marvellous
      power. Now this was the faith of these of which I have spoken; they are young, and their minds
      are firm; and they do put their trust in God continually. And now it came to pass that after
      we had thus taken care of our wounded men, and had buried our dead, and also the dead of the
      Lamanites, which were many, behold, we did inquire of Gid concerning the prisoners which they
      had started to go down to the land of Zarahemla with. Now Gid was the Chief Captain over the
      band which was appointed to guard them down to the land. And now, these are the words which
      Gid said unto me: Behold, we did start to go down to the land of Zarahemla, with our
      prisoners. And it came to pass that we did meet the spies of our armies, which had been sent
      out to watch the camp of the Lamanites. And they cried unto us, saying: Behold the armies of
      the Lamanites are a marching towards the city of Cumeni; and behold, they will fall upon them,
      yea, and will destroy our people. And it came to pass that our prisoners did hear their cries,
      which caused them to take courage; and they did rise up in rebellion against us. And it came
      to pass because of their rebellion, we did cause that our sword should come upon them. And it
      came to pass that they did, in a body, run upon our swords, in the which, the greater number
      of them were slain; and the remainder of them broke through and fled from us. And behold, when
      they had fled, and we could not overtake them, we took our march with speed towards the city
      Cumeni; and behold, we did arrive in time that we might assist our brethren in preserving the
      city. And behold, we are again delivered out of the hands of our enemies. And blessed is the
      name of our God: for behold, it is he that hath delivered us; yea, that hath done this great
      thing for us. Now it came to pass that when I, Helaman, had heard these words of Gid, I was
      filled with exceeding joy, because of the goodness of God preserving us, that we might not all
      perish; yea, and I trust that the souls of them which has been slain, have entered into the
      rest of their God. </text>

    <text> And behold, now it came to pass that our next object was to obtain the city of Manti; but
      behold, there was no way that we could lead them out of the city, by our small bands. For
      behold, they remembered that which we had hitherto done; therefore we could not decoy them
      away from their strong holds; and they were so exceeding numerous than was our army, that we
      durst not go forth and attack them in their strong holds. Yea, and it became expedient that we
      should employ our men, to the maintaining those parts of the land, of which we had retained of
      our possessions; therefore it became expedient that we should wait, that we might receive more
      strength from the land of Zarahemla, and also a new supply of provisions. And it came to pass
      that I thus did send an embassy to the governor of our land, to acquaint him concerning the
      affairs of our people. And it came to pass that we did wait to receive provisions and
      strength, from the land of Zarahemla. But behold, this did not profit us but little: for the
      Lamanites were also receiving great strength, from day to day, and also many provisions; and
      thus were our circumstances at this period of time. And the Lamanitas were sallying forth
      against us, from time to time, resolving by stratagem, to destroy us; nevertheless, we could
      not come to battle with them, because of their retreats and their strong holds. And it came to
      pass that we did wait in these difficult circumstances, for the space of many months, even
      until we were about to perish for the want of food. But it came to pass that we did receive
      food, which was guarded to us by an army of two thousand men, to our assistance; and this is
      all the assistance which we did receive, to defend ourselves and our country from falling into
      the hands of our enemies; yea, to contend with an enemy which was innumerable. And now the
      cause of these embarrassments, or the cause why they did not send more strength unto us, we
      knew not; therefore we were grieved, and also filled with fear, lest by any means the
      judgments of God should come upon our land, to our overthrow and utter destruction; therefore
      we did pour out our souls in prayer to God, that he would strengthen us and deliver us out of
      the hands of our enemies; yea, and also give us strength, that we might retain our cities, and
      our lands, and our possessions, for the support of our people. Yea, and it came to pass that
      the Lord our God did visit us with assurances, that he would deliver us; yea, insomuch that he
      did speak peace to our souls, and did grant unto us as great faith, and did cause us that we
      should hope for our deliverance in him; and we did take courage with our small force which we
      had received, and were fixed with a determination to conquer our enemies, and to maintain our
      lands, and our possessions, and our wives, and our children, and the cause of our liberty. And
      thus we did go forth with all our might against the Lamanites, which were in the city of
      Manti; and we did pitch our tents by the wilderness side, which was near to the city. And it
      came to pass that on the morrow, that when the Lamanites saw that we were in the borders by
      the wilderness which was near the city, that they sent out their spies round about us, that
      they might discover the number and the strength of our army. And it came to pass that when
      they saw that we were not strong, according to our numhers, and fearing that we should cut
      them off from their support, except they should come out to battle against us, and kill us,
      and also supposing that they could easily destroy us with their numerous hosts, therefore they
      began to make preparations to come out against us to battle. And when we saw that they were
      making preparations to come out against us, behold, I caused that Gid, with a small number of
      men, should secrete himself in the wilderness, and also that Teomner should, with a small
      number of men, secrete themselves also in the wilderness. Now Gid and his men was on the
      right, and others on the left; and when they had thus secreted themselves, behold, I remained
      with the remainder of my army, in that same place where we had first pitched our tents,
      against the time that the Lamanites should come out to battle. And it came to pass that the
      Lamanites did come out with their numerous army against us. And when they had come, and were
      about to fall upon us with the sword, I caused that my men, those which were with me, should
      retreat into the wilderness. And it came to pass that the Lamanites did follow after us with
      great speed, for they were exceedingly desirous to overtake us, that they might slay us;
      therefore they did follow us into the wilderness; and we did pass by in the midst of Gid and
      Teomner, insomuch that they were not discovered by the Lamanites. And it came to pass that
      when the Lamanites had passed by, or when the army had passed by, Gid and Teomner did rise up
      from their secret places, and did cut off the spies of the Lamanites, that they should not
      return to the city. And it came to pass that when they had cut them off, they ran to the city,
      and fell upon the guards which were left to guard the city, insomuch that they did destroy
      them, and did take possession of the city. Now this was done, because the Lamanites did suffer
      their whole army, save a few guards only, to be led away into the wilderness. And it came to
      pass that Gid and Teomner, by this means, had obtained possession of their strong holds. And
      it came to pass that we took our course, after having travelled much in the wilderness,
      towards the land of Zarahemla. And when the Lamanites saw that they were marching towards the
      land of Zarahemla, they were exceeding fraid, lest there was a plan laid to lead them on to
      destruction; therefore they began to retreat into the wilderness again, yea, even back by the
      same way which they had came. And behold, it was night, and they did pitch their tents; for
      the Chief Captains of the Lamanites had supposed that the Nephites were weary, because of
      their march; and supposing that they had driven their whole army, therefore they took no
      thought concerning the city of Manti. Now it came to pass that when it was night, that I
      caused that my men should not sleep, but that they should march forward, by another way,
      towards the land of Manti. And because of this our march in the night time, behold, on the
      morrow, we were beyond the Lamanites, insomuch that we did arrive before them to the city of
      Manti. And thus it came to pass, that by this stratagem, we did take possession of the city of
      Manti, without the shedding of blood. And it came to pass that when the armies of the
      Lamanites did arrive near the city, and saw that we were prepared to meet them, they were
      astonished exceedingly, and struck with great fear, insomuch that they did flee into the
      wilderness. --Yea, and it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites did flee out of all
      this quarter of the land. But behold, they have carried with them many women and children out
      of the land. And those cities which had been taken by the Lamanites, all of them are at this
      period of time, in our possession; and our fathers, and our women, and our children, are
      returning to their homes, all save it be those which have been taken prisoners and carried off
      by the Lamanites. But behold, our armies are small, to maintain so great a number of cities,
      and so great possessions. But behold, we trust that our God, who hath given us victory over
      those lands, insomuch that we have obtained those cities and those lands, which were our own.
      Now we do not know the cause that the government does not grant us more strength; neither do
      those men which came up unto us, know why we have not received greater strength. Behold, we
      do, not know but what ye are unsuccessful, and ye have drawn away the forces into that quarter
      of the land; if so, we do not desire to murmur. And if it is not so, behold, we fear that
      there is some faction in the government, that they do not send more men to our assistance; for
      we know that they are more numerous than that which they have sent. But behold, it mattereth
      not; we trust God will deliver us, notwithstanding the weakness of our armies, yea, and
      deliver us out of the hands of our enemies. --Behold, this is the twenty and ninth year, in
      the latter end, and we are in the possession of our lands; and the lamanites have fled to the
      land of Nephi. And those sons of the people of Ammon, of which I have so highly spoken, are
      with me in the city of Manti; and the Lord hath supported them, yea, and kept them from
      falling by the sword, insomuch that even one soul hath not been slain. But behold, they have
      received many wounds; nevertheless they stand fast in that liberty wherewith God hath made
      them free; and they are strict to remember the Lord their God, from day to day; yea, they do
      observe to keep his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments continually; and their
      faith is strong in the prophecies concerning that which is to come. And now my beloved brother
      Moroni, that the Lord our god who hath redeemed us and made us free, may keep you continually
      in his presence; yea, and that he may favor this people, even that ye may have success in
      obtaining the possessions of all that which the Lamanites hath taken from us, which was for
      our support. And now behold, I close mine epistle. I am Helaman, the son of Alma. </text>

    <text> Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of
      Nephi, after Moroni had received and had read Helaman's epistle, he was exceedingly rejoiced
      because of the welfare, yea, the exceeding success which Helaman had had in obtaining those
      lands which were lost; yea, and he did make it known unto all his people in all the land round
      about in that part where he was, that they might rejoice also. And it came to pass that he
      immediately sent an epistle to Pahoran, desiring that he should cause men to be gathered
      together, to strengthen Helaman, or the armies of Helaman, insomuch that he might with ease
      maintain that part of the land which he had been so miraculously prospered in retaining. --And
      it came to pass when Moroni had sent this epistle to the land of Zarahemla, he began again to
      lay a plan, that he might obtain the remainder of those possessions and cities which the
      Lamanites had taken from them. And it came to pass that while Moroni was thus making
      preparations to go against the Lamanites to battle, behold, the people of Nephihah which were
      gathered together from the city of Moroni, and the city of Lehi, and the city of Morianton,
      were attacked by the Lamanites; yea, even those which had been compelled to flee from the land
      of Manti, and from the land round about, had come over and joined the Lamanites in this part
      of the land; and thus being exceeding numerous, yea, and receiving strength from day to day,
      by the command of Ammoron, they came forth against the people of Nephihah, and they did begin
      to slay them with an exceeding great slaughter. And their armies were so numerous, that the
      remainder of the people of Nephihah were obliged to flee before them; and they came even and
      joined the army of Moroni. --And now as Moroni had supposed that there should be men sent to
      the city of Nephihah, to the assistance of the people to maintain that city, and knowing that
      it was easier to keep the city from falling into the hands of the Lamanites, than to retake it
      from them, he supposed that they would easily maintain that city; therefore he retained all
      his force to maintain those places whieh he had recovered. And now when Moroni saw that the
      city of Nephihah was lost, he was exceeding sorrowful, and began to doubt, because of the
      wickedness of the people, whether they should not fall into the hands of their brethren. Now
      this was the case with all his Chief Captains. They doubted and marvelled also, because of the
      wickedness of the people; and this because of the success of the Lamanites over them. And it
      came to pass that Moroni was angry with the government, because of their indifference
      concerning the freedom of their country. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that he wrote again to the governor of the land, which was Pahoran,
      and these are the words which he wrote, saying, Behold, I direct mine epistle to Pahoran, in
      the city of Zarahemla, which is the Chief Judge and the governor over the land, and also to
      all those who hath been chosen by this people to govern and manage the affairs of this war;
      for behold, I have somewhat to say unto them by the way of condemnation; for behold, ye
      yourselves know that ye appointed to gather together men, and arm them with swords, and with
      cimeters, and all manner of weapons of war, of every kind, and sent forth against the
      Lamanites, in whatsoever parts they should come into our land. And now behold, I say unto you,
      That myself, and also my men, and also Helaman and his men, have suffered exceeding great
      sufferings; yea, even hunger, thirst, and fatigue, and all manner of afflictions of every
      kind. But behold, were this all we had suffered, we would not murmur or complain; but behold,
      great has been the slaughter among our people; yea, thousands have fallen by the sword, while
      it might have otherwise been, if ye had rendered unto our armies sufficient strength and
      succor for them. Yea, great has been your neglect towards us. And now behold, we desire to
      know the cause of this exceeding great neglect; yea, we desire to know the cause of your
      thoughtless state. Can you think to sit upon your thrones, in a state of thoughtless stupor,
      while your enemies are spreading the work of death around you?. Yea, while they are murdering
      thousands of your brethren; yea, even they which have looked up to you for protection, yea,
      have placed you in a situation that ye might have succored them, and have saved thousands of
      them from falling by the sword?. But behold, this is not all: Ye have withheld your provisions
      from them, insomuch that many have fought and bled out their lives because of their great
      desires which they had for the welfare of this people; yea, and this they have done, when they
      were about to perish with hunger, because of your exceeding great neglect towards them. And
      now, my beloved brethren; for ye had ought to be beloved; yea, and ye had ought to have
      stirred yourselves more diligently for the welfare and the freedom of this people: but behold,
      ye have neglected them, insomuch that the blood of thousands shall come upon your heads, for
      vengeance; yea, for known unto God were all the cries, and all their sufferings. Behold, could
      ye suppose that ye could sit upon your thrones, and because of the exceeding goodness of God,
      ye could not do nothing, and he would deliver you?. Behold, if ye have supposed this, ye have
      supposed in vain. Do ye suppose that, because so many of your brethren have been killed,
      because of their wickedness?. I say unto you, if ye supposed this, ye have supposed in vain:
      for I say unto you, there are many which have fallen by the sword; and behold, it is to your
      condemnation; for the Lord suffereth the righteous, to be slain, that his justice and judgment
      may come upon the wicked; therefore ye need not suppose that the righteous are lost because
      they are slain; but behold, they do enter into a rest of the Lord their God. And now behold, I
      say unto you, I fear exceedingly that the judgments of God will come upon this people, because
      of their exceeding slothfulness; yea, even the slothfulness of our government, and their
      exceeding great neglect towards their brethren, yea, towards those which have been slain: For
      were it not for the wickedness which first commenced at our head, we could not have withstood
      our enemies, that they could have gained power over us; yea, had it not been for the war which
      broke out among ourselves; yea, were it not for these king-men, which caused so much bloodshed
      among ourselves, if we had united our strength, as we hitherto have done; yea, had it not been
      for the desires of the power and authority which those king-men had over us; had they been
      true to the cause of our freedom, and united with us, and gone forth against our enemies,
      instead of taking up their swords against us, which was the cause of so much bloodshed among
      ourselves; yea if we had gone forth against them, in the strength of the Lord, we should have
      dispersed our enemies; for it would have been done according to the fulfilling of his word.
      But behold, now the Lamanites are coming upon us, and they are murdering our people with the
      sword; yea, our women and children; taking possession of, our lands, and also carrying them
      away captive; causing them that they should suffer all manner of afflictions; and this because
      of the great wickedness of those who are seeking for power and authority; yea, even those
      king-men. But why should I say much concerning this matter, for we know not but what ye
      yourselves are seeking for authority?. We know not but what ye are also traitors to your
      country?. Or is it that ye have neglected us because ye are in the heart of our country, and
      ye are surrounded by security, that ye do not cause food to be sent unto us, and also men to
      strengthen our armies?. Have ye forgot the commandments of the Lord your God?. Yea, have ye
      forgot the captivity of our fathers?. Have ye forgot the many times we have been delivered out
      of the hands of our enemies? Or do ye suppose that the Lord will still deliver us, while we
      sit upon our thrones, and do not make use of the means which the Lord hath provided for us?.
      Yea, will ye sit in idleness, while ye are surrounded with thousands of those, yea, and tens
      of thousands, which do also sit in idleness, while there are thousands round about in the
      borders of the land, which are falling by the sword, yea, wounded and bleeding?. Do ye suppose
      that God will look upon us as guiltless, while we sit still and behold these things?. Behold,
      I say unto you, Nay. Now I would that ye should remember that God hath said that The inward
      vessel shall be cleansed first, and then shall the outer vessel be cleansed also. And now
      except ye do repent of that which ye have done, and begin to be up and doing, and send forth
      food and men unto us, and also unto Helaman, that he may support those parts of our country
      which he hath retained, and that ye may also recover the remainder of our possessions in these
      parts, behold it will be expedient that we contend no more with the Lamanites until we have
      first cleansed our inward vessel; yea, even the great head of our government; and except ye
      grant mine epistle, and come out and shew unto me a true spirit of freedom, and strive to
      strengthen and fortify our armies, and grant unto them food for their support, behold I will
      leave a part of my freemen to maintain this part of our land, and I will leave the strength
      and the blessings of God upon them, that none other power can operate against them; and this
      because of their exceeding faith and patience in their tribulations; and I will come unto you,
      and if there be any among you that hath a desire for freedom, yea, if there be even a spark of
      freedom remaining, behold, I will stir up insurrections among you, even until those who hath
      desires to usurp power and authority, shall become extinct; yea, behold I do not fear your
      power nor your authority, but it is my God whom I fear, and it is according to his
      commandments that I do take my sword to defend the cause of my country, and it is because of
      your iniquity that we have suffered so much loss. Behold it is time, yea, the time is now at
      hand, that except ye do bestir yourselves in the defence of your country and your little ones,
      the sword of justice doth hang over you; yea, and it shall fall upon you and visit you even to
      your utter destruction. Behold, I wait for assistance from you, and except ye do administer
      unto our relief, behold I come unto you even into the land of Zarahemla, and smite you with
      the sword, insomuch that ye can have no more power to impede the progress of this people in
      the cause of freedom; for behold the Lord will not suffer that ye shall live and wax strong in
      your iniquities, to destroy his righteous people. Behold, can you suppose that the Lord will
      spare you and come out in judgment against the Lamanites, when it is the tradition of their
      fathers that hath caused their hatred; yea, and it hath been redoubled by those which have
      dissented from us, while your iniquity is for the cause of your love and glory, and the vain
      things of the world?. Ye know that ye do transgress the laws of god, and ye do know that ye do
      trample them under your feet. Behold, the Lord saith unto me, if those whom ye have appointed
      your governors, do not repent of their sins and iniquities, ye shall go up to battle against
      them. And now behold, I Moroni am constrained, according to the covenant which I have made to
      keep the commandments of my God; therefore I would that ye should adhear to the word of God,
      and send speedily unto me of your provisions and of your men, and also Helaman. And behold if
      ye will not do this, I come unto you speedily; for behold, God will not suffer that we should
      perish with hunger; therefore he will give unto us of your food, even if it must be by the
      sword. Now see that ye fulfill the word of God. Behold, I am Moroni, your Chief Captain. I
      seek not for power but to pull it down. I seek not for honor of the world, but for the glory
      of my God, and the freedom and welfare of my country. And thus I close mine epistle. </text>

    <text> Behold, now it came to pass that soon after Moroni had sent his epistle unto the Chief
      Governor, he received and epistle from Pahoran, the Chief Governor. And these are the words
      which he received: I, Pahoran, which art the Chief Governor of this land, do send these words
      unto Moroni, the Chief Captain over the army: Behold, I say unto you, Moroni, That I do not
      joy in your great afflictions; yea, it grieves my soul. Behold, there are those are those who
      do joy in your afflictions; yea, insomuch that they have risen up in rebellion against me, and
      also those of my people which are freemen; yea, and those which have risen up, are exceeding
      numerous. And it is those who have sought to take away the judgment seat from me, that have
      been the cause of this great iniquity; for they have used great flattery; and they have led
      away the hearts of many people, which will be the cause of sore affliction among us; they have
      withheld our provisions, and have daunted our freemen, that they have not come unto you. And
      behold, they have driven me out before them, and I have fled to the land of Gideon, with as
      many men as it were possible that I could get. And behold, I have sent a proclamation
      throughout this part of the land; and behold, they are flocking to us daily, to their arms, in
      the defence of their country, and their freedom, and to avenge our wrong doings. And they have
      come unto us, insomuch that those which have rose up in rebellion against us, are set at
      defiance; yea, insomuch that they do fear us, and durst not come out against us to battle.
      They have got possession of the land, or the city of Zarahemla; they have appointed a king
      over them, and he hath written unto the king of the Lamanites, in the which he hath joined an
      alliance with him; in the which alliance, he hath agreed to maintain the city of Zarahemla, in
      the which maintenance, he supposeth will enable the Lamanites to conquer the remainder of the
      land, and he shall be placed king over this people, when they shall be conquered under the
      Lamanites. And now, in your epistle, ye have censured me; but it mattereth not, I am not
      angry, but do rejoice in the greatness of your heart. I, Pahoran, do not seek power, save only
      to retain my judgment seat, that I may preserve the rights and the liberty of my people. My
      soul standeth fast in that liberty, in the which God hath made us free. And now behold we will
      resist wickedness even unto bloodshed. We would not shed the blood of the Lamanites, if they
      would stay in their own land. We would not shed the blood of our brethren, if they would not
      rise up in rebellion and take the sword against us. We would not subject ourselves to the yoke
      of bondage, if it were requisite with the justice of God, or if he should command us so to do.
      But behold he doth not command us that we shall subject ourselves to our enemies, but that we
      should put our trust in him, and he will deliver us. Therefore my beloved brother Moroni, let
      us resist evil; and whatsoever evil we cannot resist with our words, yea, such as rebellions
      and dissentions, let us resist them with our swords, that we may retain our freedom, that we
      may rejoice in the great privilege of our church and in the cause of our Redeemer and our God.
      Therefore come unto me speedily, with a few of your men, and leave the remainder in the charge
      of Lehi and Teancum; give unto them power to conduct the war in that part of the land,
      according to the spirit of God, which is also the spirit of freedom, which is in them. Behold
      I have sent a few provisions unto them, that they may not perish until ye can come unto me.
      Gather together whatsoever force ye can upon your march hither, and we will go speedily
      against those dissenters, in the strength of our God, according to the faith which is in us.
      And we will take possession of the city of Zarahemla, that we may obtain more food to send
      forth unto Lehi and Teancum; yea, we will go forth against them in the strength of the Lord,
      and we will put and end to this great iniquity. And now Moroni, I do joy in receiving your
      epistle; for I was somewhat worried concerning what we should do, whether it should be just in
      us to go against our brethren. But ye have said, Except they repent, the Lord hath commanded
      you that ye should go against them. See that ye strengthen Lehi and Teancum in the Lord; tell
      them to fear not, for God will deliver them: yea, and also all those who stand fast in that
      liberty wherewith God hath made them free. And now I close mine epistle to my beloved brother
      Moroni. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that when Moroni had received this epistle, his heart did take
      courage, and was filled with exceeding great joy, because of the faithfulness of Pahoran, that
      he was not also a traitor to the freedom and cause of his country. But he did also mourn
      exceedingly, because of the iniquity of those who had driven Pahoran from the judgment seat;
      yea, in fine, because of those who had rebelled against their country and also their God. And
      it came to pass that Moroni took a small number of men, according to the desire of Pahoran,
      and gave Lehi and Teancum command over the remainder of his army, and took his march towards
      the land of Gideon. And he did raise the standard of liberty in whatsoever place he did enter,
      and gained whatsoever force he could in all his march towards the land of Gideon. And it came
      to pass that thousands did flock unto his standard, and did take up their swords in the
      defence of their freedom, that they might not come into bondage. And thus when Moroni had
      gathered together whatsoever men he could in all his march, he came to the land of Gideon; and
      uniting his forces with that of Pahoran, they became exceeding strong, even stronger than the
      men of Pachus, which was the king of those dissenters which had driven out the freemen out of
      the land of Zarahemla, and had taken possession of the land. And it came to pass that Moroni
      and Pahoran went down with their armies into the land of Zarahemla, and went forth against the
      city, and did meet the men of Pachus, insomuch that they did come to battle. And behold,
      Pachus was slain, and his men were taken prisoners; and Pahoran was restored to his judgment
      seat. And the men of Pachus received their trial, according to the law, and also those
      king-men which had been taken and cast into prison; and they were executed according to the
      law; yea, those men of Pachus, and those king-men, whosoever would not take up arms in the
      defence of their country, but would fight against it, were put to, death. --And thus it became
      expedient that this law should be strictly observed, for the safety of their country; yea, and
      whosoever was found denying their freedom, was speedily executed according to the law. And
      thus ended the thirtieth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi: Moroni and
      Pahoran having restored peace to the land of Zarahemla, among their own people, having
      inflicted death upon all those who were not true to the cause of freedom. And it came to pass
      in the commencement of the thirty and first year of the reign of the Judges over the people of
      Nephi, Moroni immediately caused that provisions should be sent, and also an army of six
      thousand men, should be sent unto Helaman, to assist him in preserving that part of the land;
      and he also caused that an army of six thousand men, with a sufficient quantity of food,
      should be sent to the armies of Lehi and Teancum, And it came to pass that this was done, to
      fortify the land against the Lamanites. And it came to pass that Moroni and Pahoran, leaving a
      large body of men in the land of Zarahemla, took their march with a large body of men towards
      the land of Nephihah, being determined to overthrow the Lamanites in that city. And it came to
      pass that as they were marching towards the land, they took a large body of the Lamanites, and
      slew many of them, and took their provisions, and their weapons of war. And it came to pass
      after they had took them, they caused them to enter into a covenant, that they would no more
      take up their weapons of war against the Nephites. And when they had entered into this
      covenant, they sent them to dwell with the people of Ammon; and they were in number about four
      thousand, which had not been slain. And it came to pass that when they had sent them away,
      they pursued their march towards the land of Nephihah. And it came to pass that when they had
      come to the city Nephihah, they did pitch their tents in the plains of Nephihah, which was
      near the city Nephihah. Now Moroni was desirous that the Lamanites should come out to battle
      against them, upon the plains; but the Lamanites knowing of their exceeding great courage, and
      beholding the greatness of their numbers, therefore they durst not come out against them;
      therefore they did not come to battle in that day. And when the night came, Moroni went forth
      in the darkness of the night, and came upon the top of the wall to spy out in what part of the
      city the Lamanites did camp with their army. And it came to pass that they were on the east,
      by the entrance; and they were all asleep. And now Moroni returned to his army, and caused
      that they should prepare in haste strong cords and ladders, to be let down from the top of the
      wall into the inner part of the wall. And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his men
      should march forth and come upon the top of the wall, and let themselves down into that part
      of the city, yea, even on the west, where the Lamanites did not camp with their armies. And it
      came to pass that they were all let down into the city by night, by the means of their strong
      cords and their ladders; thus when the morning came, they were all within the walls of the
      city. And now when the Lamanites awoke, and saw that the armies of Moroni were within the
      walls, they were affrighted exceedingly, insomuch that they did flee out by the pass. And now
      when Moroni saw that they were fleeing before him, he did cause that his men should march
      forth against them, and slew many, and surrounded many others and took them prisoners; and the
      remainder of them fled into the land of Moroni, which was in the borders by the seashore. Thus
      had Moroni and Pahoran obtained the possession of the city of Nephihah, without the loss of
      one soul; and there were many of the Lamanites which were slain. Now it came to pass that many
      of the Lamanites that were prisoners, were desirous to join the people of Ammon, and become a
      free people. And it came to pass that as many as were desirous, unto them it was granted,
      according to their desires; therefore all the prisoners of the Lamanites did join the people
      of Ammon, and did begin to labor exceedingly, tilling the ground, raising all manner of grain,
      and flocks, and herds of every kind; and thus were the Nephites relieved from a great burthen;
      yea, insomuch that they were relieved from all the prisoners of the Lamanites. Now it came to
      pass that Moroni, after he had obtained possession of the city of Nephihah, having taken many
      prisoners, which did reduce the armies of the Lamanites exceedingly, and having retained many
      of the Nephites which had been taken prisones, which did strengthen the army of Moroni
      exceedingly; therefore Moroni went forth from the land of Nephihah to the land of Lehi. And it
      came to pass that when the Lamanites saw Moroni was a coming against them, they were
      frightened, and fled before the army of Moroni. And it came to pass that Moroni and his army
      did pursue them from city to city, until they were met by Lehi and Teancum; and the Lamanites
      fled from Lehi and Teancum, even down upon the borders by the seashore, until they came to the
      land of Moroni. And the armies of the Lamanites were all gathered together, insomuch that they
      were all in one body, in the land of Moroni. Now Ammoron, the king of the Lamanites, was also
      with them. And it came to pass that Moroni, and Lehi, and Teancum, did encamp with their
      armies round about in the borders of the land of Moroni, insomuch that the Lamanites were
      encircled about in the borders by the wilderness, on the south, and in the borders by the
      wilderness on the east; and thus they did camp for the night. For behold, the Nephites and the
      Lamanites also, were weary because of the greatness of the march; therefore they did not
      resolve upon any stratagem in the night time, save it were Teancum: for he was exceeding angry
      with Ammoron, insomuch that he considered that Ammoron, and Amalickiah his brother, had been
      the cause of this great and lasting war between them and the Lamanites. which had been the
      cause of so much war and bloodshed, yea, and so much famine. And it came to pass that Teancum,
      in his anger, did go forth into the camp of the Lamanites, and did let himself down over the
      walls of the city. And he went forth with a cord, from place to place, insomuch that he did
      find the king; and he did cast a javelin at him, which did pierce him near the heart. --But
      behold, the king did awake his servant before he died, insomuch that they did pursue Teancum,
      and slew him. Now it came to pass that when Lehi and Moroni knew that Teancum was dead, they
      were exceeding sorrowful: for behold, he had been a man which fought valiantly for his
      country, yea, a true friend to liberty; and he had suffered very many exceeding sore
      afflictions. But behold, he was dead, and had gone the way of all the earth. Now it came to
      pass that Moroni marched forth on the morrow, and came upon the Lamanites, insomuch that they
      did slay them with a great slaughter; and they did drive them out of the land; and they did
      flee, even that they did not return at that time against the Nephites. And thus ended the
      thirty and first year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi; and thus they had
      had wars, and bloodsheds, and famine, and affliction, for the space of many years. And there
      had been murders, and contentions, and dissensions, and all manner of iniquity among the
      people of Nephi; nevertheless, for the righteous' sake, yea, because of the prayers of the
      righteous , they were spared. But behold, because of the exceeding great length of the war
      between the Nephites and the Lamanites, many had become hardened, because of the exceeding
      great length of the war; and many were softened, because of their afflictions, insomuch that
      they did humble themselves before God, even in the depth of humility. And it came to pass that
      after Moroni had fortified those parts of the land which were most exposed to the Lamanites,
      until they were sufficiently strong, he returned to the city of Zarahemla, and also Helaman
      returned to the place of his inheritance; and there was once more peace established among the
      people of Nephi. And Moroni yielded up the command of his armies into the hands of his son,
      whose name was Moronihah; and he retired to his own house, that he might spend the remainder
      of his days in peace. And Pahoran did return to his judgment seat; and Helaman did take upon
      him again to preach unto the people the word of God: for because of so many wars and
      contentions, it had become expedient that a regulation should be made again in the church;
      therefore Helaman and his brethren went forth, and did declare the word of Gid with much
      power, unto the convincing of many people of their wickedness, which did cause them to repent
      of their sins, and to be baptized unto the Lord their God. And it came to pass that they did
      establish again the church of God, throughout all the land; yea, and regulations were made
      concerning the law. And their Judges, and their Chief Judges were chosen. And the people of
      Nephi began to prosper again in the land, and began to multiply and to wax exceeding strong
      again in the land. And they began to grow exceeding rich; but notwithstanding their riches, or
      their strength, or their prosperity, they were not lifted up in pride of their eyes; neither
      were they slow to remember the Lord their God; but they did humble themselves exceedingly
      before him; yea, they did remember how great things the Lord hath done for them, that he had
      delivered them from death, and from bonds, and from prisons, and from all manner of
      afflictions; and he had delivered them out of the hands of their enemies. And they did pray
      unto the Lord their god continually, insomuch that the Lord did bless them, according to his
      word, so that they did wax strong, and prosper in the land. And it came to pass that all these
      things were done. And Helaman died, in the thirty and fifth year of the reign of the Judges
      over the people of Nephi. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass in the commencement of the thirty and sixth year of the reign of the
      Judges over the people of Nephi, that Shiblon took possession of those sacred things which had
      been delivered unto Helaman by Alma; and he was a just man, and he did walk uprightly before
      God; and he did observe to do good continually, to keep the commandments of the Lord his God;
      and also did his brother. And it came to pass that Moroni died also. And thus ended the thirty
      and sixth year of the reign of the Judges. And it came to pass that in the thirty and seventh
      year of the reign of the Judges, there was a large company of men, even to the amount of five
      thousand and four hundred men, with their wives and their children, departed out of the land
      of Zarahemla, into the land which was northward. And it came to pass that Hagoth, he being an
      exceeding curious man, therefore he went forth and built him an exceeding large ship, on the
      borders of the land Bountiful, by the land Desolation, and launched it forth into the West
      Sea, by the narrow neck which led into the land northward. And behold, there were many
      Nephites which did enter therein, and did sail forth with much provisions, and also many women
      and children; and they took their course northward. And thus ended the thirty and seventh
      year. And in the thirty and eighth year, this man built other ships. And the first ship did
      also return, and many more people did enter into it; and they also took much provisions, and
      set out again to the land northward. And it came to pass that they were never heard of more.
      --And we suppose that they were drowned up in the depths of the sea. And it came to pass that
      one other ship also did sail forth; and whither she did go, we know not. And it came to pass
      that in this year, there were many people which went forth into the land northward. And thus
      ended the thirty and eighth year. And it came to pass in the thirty and ninth year of the
      reign of the Judges, Shiblon died also, and Corianton had gone forth to the land northward, in
      a ship, to carry forth provisions unto the people which had gone forth into the land;
      therefore it became expedient for Shiblon to confer those sacred things, before his death,
      upon the son of Helaman, who was called Helaman, being called after the name of his father.
      Now behold, all those engravings which were in the possession of Helaman, were written and
      sent forth among the children of men throughout all the land, save it were those parts which
      had been commanded by Alma should not go forth. Nevertheless these things were to be kept
      sacred, and handed down from one generation to another; therefore, in this year, they had been
      conferred upon Helaman, before the death of Shiblon. And it came to pass also in this year,
      that there were dissenters which had gone forth unto the Lamanites; and they were stirred up
      again to anger against the Nephites. And also in this same year, they came down with a
      numerous army to war against the people of Moronihah, or against the army of Moronihah, in the
      which they were beaten, and driven back again to their own lands, suffering great loss. And
      thus ended the thirty ninth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi. And thus
      ended the account of Alma, and Helaman his son, and also Shiblon, which was his son. </text>

    <text> And now behold, it came to pass in the commencement of the fortieth year of the reign of
      Judges over the people of Nephi, there began to be a serious difficulty among the people of
      the Nephites. For behold, Pahoran had died and gone all the way of all the earth; therefore
      there began to be a serious contention concerning who should have the judgment seat among the
      brethren, which were the sons of Pahoran. Now these are there names which did contend for the
      judgment seat, which did also cause the people to contend; Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni. Now
      these are not all the sons of Pahoran, (for he had many,) but these are they which did contend
      for the judgment seat; therefore they did cause three divisions among the people.
      Nevertheless, it came to pass that Pahoran was appointed by the voice of the people to be a
      Chief Judge and a governor over the people of Nephi. And it came to pass that Pacumeni, when
      he saw that he could not obtain the judgment seat, he did unite with the voice of the people.
      But behold, Paanchi, and that part of the people that were desirous that he should be their
      governor, was exceeding wroth; therefore he was about to flatter away those people to rise up
      in rebellion against their brethren. And it came to pass as he was about to do this, behold,
      he was taken, and was tried according to the voice of the people, and condemned unto death;
      for he had raised up in rebellion, and sought to destroy the liberty of the people. Now when
      those people which were desirous that he should be their governor, saw that he was condemned
      unto death, therefore they were angry; and behold, they sent forth one Kishkumen, even to the
      judgment seat of Pahoran, and murdered Pahoran as he sat upon the judgment seat. And he was
      pursued by the servants of Pahoran; but behold, so speedy was the flight of Kishkumen, that no
      man could overtake him. And he went unto those that sent him, and they all entered into a
      covenant, yea, swearing by their everlasting Maker, that they would tell no man that Kishkumen
      had murdered Pahoran; therefore Kishkumen was not known among the people of Nephi, for he was
      in disguise at the time that he murdered Pahoran. And Kishkumen, and his band which was
      covenanted with him, did mingle themselves among the people, in a manner that they all could
      not be found; but as many as were found, were condemned unto death. And now behold, Pacumeni
      was appointed, according to the voice of the people, to be a Chief Judge and a govereor over
      the people, to reign in the stead of his brother Pahoran; and it was according to his right.
      And all this was done, in the fortieth year of the reign of the Judges; and it had an end. And
      it came to pass in the forty and first year of the reign of the Judges, that the Lamanites had
      gathered together an innumerable army of men, and armed them with swords, and with cimeters,
      and with bows, and with arrows, and with head-plates, and with breast-plates, and with all
      manner of shields of every kind; and they came down again, that they might pitch battle
      against the Nephites. And they were led by a man whose name was Coriantumr; and he was a
      descendant of Zarahemla; and he was a dissenter from among the Nephites; and he was a large
      and mighty man; therefore the king of the Lamanites, whose name was Tubaloth, who was the son
      of Ammoron. Now Tubaloth supposing that Coriantumr, he being a mighty man, could stand against
      the Nephites, insomuch with his strength, and also with his great wisdom, that by sending him
      forth, he should gain power over the Nephites; therefore he did stir them up to anger, and he
      did gather together his armies, and he did appoint Coriantumr to be their leader, and did
      cause that they should march down to the land of Zarahemla, to battle against the Nephites.
      And it came to pass that because of so much contention and so much difficulty in the
      government, that they had not kept sufficient guards in the land of Zarahemla; for they had
      supposed that the Lamanites durst not me into the heart of their lands to attack that great
      city Zarahemla. But it came to pass that Coriantumr did march forth at the head of his
      numerous host, and came upon the inhabitants of the city, and their march was with such
      exceeding great speed, that there was no time for the Nephites to gather together their
      armies; therefore Coriantumr did cut down the watch by the entrance of the city, and did march
      forth with his whole army into the city, and they did slay every one who did oppose them,
      insomuch that they did take possession of the whole city. And it came to pass that Pacumeni,
      which was the Chief Judge, did flee before Coriantumr, even to the walls of the city. And it
      came to pass that Coriantumr did smite him against the wall, insomuch that he died. And thus
      ended the days of Pacumeni. And now when Coriantumr saw that he was in possession of the city
      of Zarahemla, and saw that the Nephites had fled before them, and were slain, and were taken,
      and were cast into prison, and that he had obtained the possession of the strongest hold in
      all the land, his heart took courage, insomuch that he was about to go forth against all the
      land. And now he did not tarry in the land of Zarahemla, but he did march forth with a large
      army, even towards the city of Bountiful; for it was his determination to go forth and cut his
      way through with the sword, that he might obtain the north parts of the land; and supposing
      that their greatest strength was in the centre of the land, therefore he did march forth,
      giving them no time to assemble themselves together, save it were in small bodies; and in this
      manner they did fall upon them and cut them down to the earth. But behold, this march of
      Coriantumr through the centre of the land, gave Moronihah great advantage over them,
      notwithstanding the greatness of the numbers of the Nephites which were slain, for behold,
      Moronihah had supposed that the Lamanites durst not come into the centre of the land, but that
      they would attack the cities round about in the borders, as they had hitherto done; therefore
      Moronihah had caused that their strong armies should maintain those parts round about by the
      borders. But behold, the Lamanites were not frightened according to his desire, but they had
      come into the centre of the land, and had taken the capital city, which was the city of
      Zarahemla, and were marching through the most capital parts of the land, slaying the people
      with a great slaughter, both men, women, and children, taking possession of many cities and of
      many strong holds. But when Moronihah had discovered this, he immediately sent forth Lehi with
      an army round about to head them, before they should come to the land Bountiful: And thus he
      did; and he did head them, before they came to the land Bountiful, and gave unto them battle,
      insomuch that they began to retreat back towards the land of Zarahemla. And it came to pass
      that Moronihah did head them in their retreat, and did give unto them battle insomuch that it
      became an exceeding bloody battle; yea, many were slain; and among the number which were
      slain, Coriantumr was also found. And now behold the Lamanites could not retreat neither way;
      neither on the north, nor on the south, nor the east, nor on the west, for they were
      surrounded on every hand by the Nephites: And thus had Coriantumr plunged the Lamanites into
      the midst of the Nephites, and he himself was slain, and the Lamanites did yield themselves
      into the hands of the Nephites. And it came to pass that Moronihah took possession of the city
      of Zarahemla again, and caused that the Lamanites which had been taken prisoners, should
      depart out of the land in peace. And thus ended the forty and first year of the reign of the
      Judges. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass in the forty and second year of the reign of Judges, after Moronihah
      had established again the peace betweem the Nephites and the Lamanites, behold there was no
      one to fill the judgment seat; therefore there began to be a contention again among the people
      concerning w should fill the judgment seat. And it came to pass that Helaman, which was the
      son of Helaman, was appointed to fill the judgment seat, by the voice of the people; but
      behold, Kishkumen, who had murdered Pahoran, did lay wait to destroy Helaman also; and he was
      upheld by his band, which had entered into a covenant that no one should know his wickedness;
      for there was one Gadianton, who was exceeding expert in many words, and also in his craft, to
      carry on the secret work of murder and robbery; therefore he became the leader of the band of
      Kishkumen; therefore he did flatter them, and also Kishkumen, that if they would place him in
      the judgment seat, he would grant unto those which belonged to his band that they should be
      placed in power and authority among the people; therefore Kishkumen sought to destroy Helaman.
      And it came to pass as he went forth towards the judgment seat, to destroy Helaman, behold one
      of the servants of Helaman, having been out by night, and having obtained, through disguise, a
      knowledge of those plans which had been laid by this band to destroy Helaman. And it came to
      pass that he met Kishkumen, and gave unto him a sign; therefore Kishkumen made known unto him
      the object of his desire, desiring that he would conduct him to the judgment seat. that he
      might murder Helaman: And it came to pass that when the servant of Helaman had known all the
      heart of Kishkumen, and how that it was his object to murder, and also that it was the object
      of all those which belonged to his band, to murder, and to rob, and to gain power, (and this
      was their secret plan, and their combination,) the servant of Helaman saith unto Kishkumen,
      Let us go forth unto the judgment seat. Now this did please Kishkumen exceedingly, for he did
      suppose that he should accomplish his design; but behold, the servant of Helaman, as they were
      going forth, unto the judgment seat, did stab Kishkumen, even to the heart, that he fell dead
      without a groan. And he ran and told Helaman all the things which he had seen, and heard, and
      done. And it came to pass that Helaman did send forth to take this band of robbers and secret
      murderers, that they might be executed according to the law. But behold, when Gadianton had
      found that Kishkumen did not return, he feared lest that he should be destroyed; therefore he
      caused that his band should follow him. And they took their flight out of the land, by a
      secret way, into the wilderness; and thus when Helaman sent forth to take them, they could no
      where be found. --And more of this Gadianton shall be spoken hereafter. And thus ended the
      forty and second year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi. And behold, in the
      end of this book, ye shall see that this Gadianton did prove the overthrow, yea, almost the
      entire destruction of the people of Nephi. --But I do not mean the end of the book of Helaman,
      but I mean the end of the Book of Nephi, from which I have taken all the account which I have
      written. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that in the forty and third year of the reign of the Judges,
      there was no contention among the people of Nephi, save it were a little pride which was in
      the church, which did cause some little dissentions among the people, which affairs were
      settled in the ending of the forty and third year. And there was no contention among the
      people in the forty and fourth year; neither was there much contention in the forty and fifth
      year. And it came to pass in the forty and sixth, yea, there were much contentions and many
      dissentions; in the which there were an exceeding great many which departed out of the land of
      Zarahemla, and went forth unto the land northward, to inherit the land; and they did travel to
      an exceeding great distance, insomuch that they came to large bodies of water, and many
      rivers; yea, and even they did spread forth into all parts of the land, into whatsoever parts
      it had not been rendered desolate, and without timber, because of the many inhabitants which
      had before inherit the land. And now no part of the land was desolate, save it were for
      timber, &amp;c.; but because of the greatness of the destruction of the people which had
      before inhabited the land, it was called desolate. And there being but little timber upon the
      face of the land, nevertheless the people which went forth, became exceeding expert in the
      working of cement; therefore they did build houses of cement, in the which they did dwell. And
      it came to pass that they did multiply and spread, and did go forth from the land southward,
      to the land northward, and did spread insomuch that they began to cover the face of the whole
      earth, from the sea south, to the sea north, from the see west, to the sea east. And the
      people which were in the land northward, did dwell in tents, and in houses of cement, and they
      did suffer whatsoever tree should spring up upon the face of the land, that it should grow up,
      that in time they might have timber to build their houses, yea, their cities, and their
      temples, and their synagogues, and their sanctuaries, and all manner of their buildings. And
      it came to pass as timber was exceeding scarce in the land northward, they did send forth much
      by the way of shipping; and thus they did enable the people in the land northward, that they
      might build many cities, both of wood and of cement. And it came to pass that there were many
      of the people of Ammon, which were Lamanites by birth, did also go forth into this land. And
      now there are many records kept of the proceedings of this people, by many of this people,
      which are particular and very large concerning them; but behold a hundredth part of the
      proceedings of this people, yea, the account of the Lamanites, and of the Nephites, and their
      wars, and contentions, and dissentions, and their preaching, and their prophecies, and their
      shipping, and their building of ships, and their building of temples, and of synagogues, and
      their sanctuaries, and their righteousness, and their wickedness, and their murders, and their
      robbings, and their plundering, and all manner of abominations and whoredoms, cannot be
      contained in this work; but behold, there are many books and records of every kind, and they
      have been kept chiefly by the Nephites; and they have been handed down from one generation to
      another, by the Nephites, even unto they have fallen into transgression, and have been
      murdered, plundered, and hunted, and driven forth, and slain, and scattered upon the face of
      the earth, and mixed with the Lamanites until they are no more called Nephites, becoming
      wicked, and wild and ferocious, yea, even becoming Lamanites. And now I return again to mine
      account; therefore what I have spoken had passed after there had been great contentions, and
      disturbances, and wars, and dissentions among the people of Nephi. The forty and sixth year of
      the reign of the Judges ended. And it came to pass that there was still great contentions in
      the land, yea, even in the forty and seventh year, and also in the forty and eighth year;
      nevertheless, Helaman did fill the judgment seat with justice and equity; yea, he did observe
      to keep the statutes, and the judgments, and the commandments of God; and he did do that which
      was right in the sight of God, continually; and he did walk after the ways of his father,
      insomuch that he did prosper in the land. And it came to pass that he had two sons. He gave
      unto the eldest the name of Nephi, and unto the youngest the name of Lehi. And they began to
      grow up unto the Lord. --And it came to pass that the wars and contentions began to cease, in
      a small degree, among the people of the Nephites, in the latter end of the forty and eighth
      year of the reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi. And it came to pass in the forty and
      ninth year of the reign of the Judges, there was continual peace established in the land, all
      save it were the secret combinations which Gadianton the nobler had established, in the more
      settled parts of the land, which at that time were not known unto those which were at the head
      of government; therefore they were not destroyed out of the land. And it came to pass that in
      this same year, there was exceeding great prosperity in the church, insomuch that there were
      thousands who did join themselves unto the church, and were baptized unto repentance; and so
      great was the prosperity of the church, and so many the blessings, which were poured out upon
      the people, that even the High Priests and the teachers were themselves astonished beyond
      measure. --And it came to pass that the work of the Lord did prosper, unto the baptizing and
      uniting to the church of God many souls; yea, even tens of thousands. Thus we may see that the
      Lord is merciful unto all who will, in the sincerity of their hearts, call upon his holy name;
      yea, thus we see that the gate of heaven is open unto all, even to those who will believe on
      the name of Jesus Christ, which is the son of God; yea, we see that whosoever will lay hold
      upon the word of God, which is quick and powerful, which shall divide asunder all the cunning,
      and the snares, and the wiles of the Devil, and lead the man of Christ in a straight and
      narrow course across that everlasting gulf of misery which is prepared to engulf the wicked,
      and land their souls, yea, their immortal souls, at the right hand of God, in the kingdom of
      Heaven, to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and with Jacob, and with all our holy fathers, to
      go no more out. And in this year there were continual rejoicing in the land of Zarahemla, and
      in all the regions round about, even in all the land which was possessed by the Nephites. And
      it came to pass that there was peace, and exceeding great joy in the remainder of the forty
      and ninth year; yea, and also there was continual peace and great joy in the fiftieth year of
      the reign of the Judges. And in the fifty and first year of the reign of the Judges, there was
      peace also save it were the pride which began to enter into the church; not into the church of
      God, but into the hearts of the people who professed to belong to the church of God; and they
      were lifted up in pride, even as to the persecution of many of their brethren. Now this was a
      great evil, which did cause the humble part of the people to suffer great persecutions, and to
      wade through much afflictions; nevertheless, they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger
      and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling
      their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of
      their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God. And
      it came to pass that the fifty and second year ended in peace also, save it were the exceeding
      great pride which had got into the hearts of the people; and it was because of their exceeding
      great riches, and their prosperity in the land; and it did grow upon them from day to day. And
      it came to pass, in the fifty and third year of the reign of the Judges, Helaman died, and his
      eldest son Nephi began to reign in his stead. And it came to pass that he did fill the
      judgment seat with justice and equity; yea, he did keep the commandments of God, and did walk
      in the ways of his father. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass in the fifty and fourth year, there were many dissentions in the
      church, and there was also a contention among the people, insomuch that there was much
      bloodshed; and the rebellious part were slain and driven out of the land, and they did go unto
      the king of the Lamanites. And it came to pass that they did endeavor to stir up the Lamanites
      to war against the Nephites; but behold, the Lamanites were exceeding fraid, insomuch that
      they would not hearken to the words of those dissenters. But it came to pass in the fifty and
      sixth year of the reign of the Judges, there were dissenters which went up from the Nephites
      unto the Lamanites; and they succeeded with those others in stirring them up to anger against
      the Nephites; and they were all that year preparing for war. And in t fifty and seventh year,
      they did come down against the Nephites to battle, and they did commence the work of death;
      yea, insomuch, that in the fifty and eighth year of the reign of the Judges, they succeeded in
      obtaining possession of the land of Zarahemla; yea, and also all the lands, even unto the land
      which was near the land Bountiful; and the Nephites, and the armies of Moronihah, were driven
      even into the land of Bountiful; and there they did fortify against the Lamanites, from the
      West Sea, even unto the East; it being a day's journey for a Nephite, on the line which they
      had fortified and stationed their armies to defend their north country. And thus those
      dissenters of the Nephites, with the help of a numerous army of the Lamanites, had obtained
      all the possession of the Nephites which was in the land southward. And all this was done in
      the fifty and eighth and ninth year of the reign of the Judges. And it came to pass in the
      sixtieth year of the reign of the Judges, Moronihah did succeed with his armies, in obtaining
      many parts of the land; yea, they retained many cities which had fallen into the hands of the
      Lamanites. And it came to pass in the sixty and first year of the reign of the Judges, they
      succeeded in retaining even the half of all their possessions. Now this great loss of the
      Nephites, and the great slaughter which was among them, would not have happened, had it not
      been for their wickedness and their abomination which was among them; yea, and it was among
      those also which professed to belong to the church of God; and it was because of the pride of
      their hearts, because of their exceeding riches, yea, it was because of their oppression to
      the poor, withholding their food from the hungry, withholding their clothing from the naked,
      and smiting their humble brethren upon the cheek, making a mock of that which was sacred,
      denying the spirit of prophecy and of revelation, murdering, plundering, lying, steeling,
      committing adultery, raising up in great contentions, and deserting away into the land of
      Nephi, among the Lamanites; and because of this their great wickedness, and their boastings in
      their own strength, they were left in their own strength; therefore they did not prosper, but
      were afflicted, and smitten, and driven before the Lamanites, until they had lost possession
      of almost all their lands. But behold, Moronihah did preach many things unto the people,
      because of their iniquity, and also Nephi and Lehi, which were the sons of Helaman, did preach
      many things unto the people; yea, and did prophesy many things unto them concerning their
      iniquities, and what should come unto them if they did not repent of their sins. And it came
      to pass that they did repent, and inasmuch as they did repent, they did begin to prosper; for
      when Moronihah saw that they did repent, he did venture to lead them forth from place to
      place, and from city to city, even until they had retained the one half of their property, and
      the one half of all their lands. And thus ended the sixty and first year of the reign of the
      Judges. And it came to pass in the sixty and second year of the reign of the Judges, that
      Moronihah could obtain no more possessions over the Lamanites; therefore they did abandon
      their design to obtain the remainder of their lands, for so numerous was the Lamanites that it
      became impossible for the Nephites to obtain more power over them; therefore Moronihah did
      employ all his armies in maintaining those parts which he had taken. And it came to pass
      because of the greatness of the number of the Lamanites, the Nephites were in great fear, lest
      they be overpowered, and trodden down, and slain, and destroyed; yea, they began to remember
      the prophecies of Alma, and also the words of Mosiah, and they saw that they had been a
      stiffnecked people, and that they had set at nought the commandments of God; and that they had
      altered and trampled under their feet the laws of Mosiah, or that which the Lord commanded him
      to give unto the people; and thus seeing that their laws had become corrupted, and that they
      had become a wicked people, insomuch that they were wicked even like unto the Lamanites. And
      because of their iniquity, the church had began to dwindle; and they began to disbelieve in
      the spirit of prophecy, and in the spirit of revelation; and the judgments of God did stare
      them in the face. And they saw that they had become weak, like unto their brethren, the
      Lamanites, and that the spirit of the Lord did no more preserve them; yea, it had withdrawn
      from them, because the spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples; therefore the Lord
      did cease to preserve them by his miraculous and matchless power, for they had fallen in a
      state of unbelief and awful wickedness; and they saw that the Lamanites were more exceeding
      numerous than they, and except they should cleave unto the Lord their God, they must
      unavoidably perish. For behold, they saw that the strength of the Lamanites was as great as
      their strength, even man for man. And thus had they fallen into this great transgression, in
      the space of not many years. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that in this same year, behold, Nephi delivered up the judgment seat,
      to a man whose name was Cezoram. For as their laws and their governments were established by
      the voice of the people, and they which chose evil were more numerous than they which chose
      good, therefore they were ripening for destruction, for the laws had been corrupted; yea, and
      this was not all; they were a stiffnecked people, insomuch that they could not be governed by
      the law nor justice, save it were to their destruction. And it came to pass that Nephi had
      become weary, because of their iniquity; and he yielded up the judgment seat, and took it upon
      him to preach the word of God all the remainder of his days, and his brother Lehi also, all
      the remainder of his days: for they remembered the words which their father Helaman spake unto
      them. And these are the words which he spake: Behold, my sons, I desire that ye should
      remember to keep the commandments of God; and I would that ye should declare unto the people
      these words: Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first parents, which came out of
      the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done, that when you remember your names, that ye may
      remember them; and when ye remember them, ye may remember their works; and when ye remember
      their works, ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were good;
      therefore, my sons, I would that ye should do that which is good, that it may be said of you,
      and also written, even as it has been said and written of them. And now my sons, behold, I
      have somewhat more to desire of you , which desire is, that ye may not do these things that ye
      may boast, but that ye may do these things to lay up for yourselves a treasure in Heaven, yea,
      which is eternal, and which fadeth not away; yea, that ye may have that precious gift of
      eternal life, which we have reason to suppose hath been given to our fathers. O remember,
      remember, my sons, the words which king Benjamin spake unto his people; yea, remember that
      there is no other way nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning blood of
      Jesus Christ, which shall come; yea, remember that he cometh to redeem the world. And remember
      also, the words which Amulek spake unto Zeezrom, in the city of Ammonihah: for he said unto
      them, That the Lord surely should come to redeem his people; but that he should not come to
      redeem them in their sins, but to redeem them from their sins. And he hath power given unto
      him from the father, to redeem them from their sins, because of repentance; therefore he hath
      sent his angels to declare the tidings of the conditions of repentance, which bringeth unto
      the power of the Redeemer, unto the salvation of their souls. --And now, my sons remember,
      remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, which is Christ, the Son of God, that ye
      must build your foundation, that when the Devil shall send forth his mighty winds; yea, h
      shafts in the whirlwind; yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it
      shall have no power over you, to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because
      of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men
      buildeth, they cannot fall. And it came to pass that these were the words which Helaman taught
      his sons; yea, he did teach them many things which are not written, and also many things which
      are written. And they did remember his words; and therefore they went forth, keeping the
      commandments of God, to teach the word of God among all the people of Nephi, beginning at the
      city Bountiful; and from thence forth to the city of Gid; and from the city of Gid to the city
      of Mulek; and even from one city to another, until they had gone forth among all the people of
      Nephi, which were in the land southward; and from thence into the land of Zarahemla, among the
      Lamanites. And it came to pass that they did preach with great power, insomuch that they did
      confound many of those dissenters which had gone over from the Nephites, insomuch that they
      came forth and did confess their sins, and were baptized unto repentance, and immediately
      returned to the Nephites, to endeavor to repair unto them the wrongs which they had done. And
      it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did preach unto the Lamanites with such great power and
      authority: for they had power and authority given unto them that they might speak; and they
      also had what they should speak, given unto them; therefore they did speak unto the great
      astonishment of the Lamanites, to the convincing them, insomuch that there were eight thousand
      of the Lamanites which were in the land of Zarahemla and round about, baptized unto
      repentance, and were convinced of the wickedness of the traditions of their fathers. And it
      came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did proceed from thence to go to the land of Nephi. And it
      came to pass that they were taken by an army of the Lamanites, and cast into prison; yea, even
      in that same prison in which Ammon and his brethren were cast by the servants of Limhi. And
      after they had been cast into prison many days without food, behold, they went forth into the
      prison to take them, that they might slay them. And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi were
      encircled about as if by fire, even insomuch that they durst not lay their hands upon them for
      fear, lest they should be burned. Nevertheless, Nephi and Lehi were not burned; and they were
      as standing in the midst of fire, and were not burned. And when they saw that they were
      encircled about with a pillar of fire, and that it burned them not, their hearts did take
      courage. For they saw that the Lamanites durst not lay their hands upon them; neither durst
      they come near unto them, but stood as if they were struck dumb with amazement. And it came to
      pass that Nephi and Lehi did stand forth, and began to speak unto them, saying: Fear not, for
      behold, it is God that hath shewn unto you this marvellous thing, in the which is shewn unto
      you, that ye cannot lay your hands on us to slay us. And behold, when they had said these
      words, the earth shook exceedingly, and the walls of the prison did shake, as if they were
      about to tumble to the earth; but behold, they did not fall. And behold, they that were in the
      prison, were Lamanites, and Nephites which were dissenters. And it came to pass that they were
      overshadowed with a cloud of darkness, and an awful, solemn fear came upon them. And it came
      to pass that there came a voice, as if it were above the cloud of darkness, saying, Repent ye,
      repent ye, and seek no more to destroy my servants which I have sent unto you to declare the
      good tidings. And it came to pass when they heard this voice, and beheld that it was not a
      voice of thunder; neither was it a voice of a great tumultous noise; but behold, it was a
      still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper, and it did pierce even to the
      very soul. And notwithstanding the mildness the voice, behold, the earth shook exceedingly,
      and the walls of the prison trembled again, as if it were about to tumble to the earth; and
      behold, the cloud of darkness which had overshadowed them, did not disperse. And behold, the
      voice came again, saying: Repent ye, repent, for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand; and seek no
      more to destroy my servants. And it came to pass that the earth shook again, and the walls
      trembled; and also again the third time the voice came, and did speak unto them marvellous
      words, which cannot be uttered by man: and the walls did tremble again, and the earth shook as
      if it were about to divide asunder. And it came to pass that the Lamanites could not flee,
      because of the cloud of darkness which did overshadow them; yea, and also they were immovable,
      because of the fear which did come upon them., Now there was one among them who was a Nephite
      by birth, who had once belonged to the church of God, but had dissented from them. And it came
      to pass that he turned him about, and behold, he saw through the cloud of darkness the faces
      of Nephi and Lehi; and behold, they did shine exceedingly, even as the face of angels. And he
      beheld that they did lift their eyes to Heaven; and they were in the attitude as if talking or
      lifting their voices to some being which they beheld. And it came to pass that this man did
      cry unto the multitude, that they might turn and look. And behold, there was power given unto
      them, that they did turn and look; and they did behold the faces of Nephi and Lehi. And they
      said unto the man, Behold, what doth all these things mean? and who is it with whom these men
      converse? Now the man's name was Aminadab. And Aminadab saith unto them, They do converse with
      the angels of God. And it came to pass that the Lamanites said unto him, What shall we do,
      that this cloud of darkness may be removed from overshadowing us? And Aminadab saith unto
      them, You must repent, and cry unto the voice, even until ye shall have faith in Christ, which
      was taught unto you by Alma, and Amulek, and by Zeesrom; and when ye shall do this, the cloud
      of darkness shall be removed from overshadowing you. And it came to pass that they all did
      begin to cry unto the voice of him which had shook the earth; yea, they did cry even until the
      cloud of darkness was dispersed. And it came to pass that when they cast their eyes about, and
      saw that the cloud of darkness was dispersed from overshadowing them, and behold, they saw
      that they were encircled about, yea, every soul, by the pillar of fire. And Nephi and Lehi was
      in the midst of them; yea, they were encircled about; yea, they were as if in the midst of a
      flaming fire, yet it did harm them not, neither did it take hold upon the walls of the prison;
      and they were filled with that joy which is unspeakable, and full of glory. And behold, the
      Holy Spirit of God did come down from Heaven, and did enter into their hearts, and they were
      filled as if with fire; and they could speak forth marvellous words. And it came to pass that
      there came a voice unto them, yea, a pleasant voice, as if it were a whisper, saying, Peace,
      peace be unto you, because of your faith in my well beloved, which was from the foundation of
      the world. And now when they heard this, they cast up their eyes as if to behold from whence
      the voice came; and behold, they saw the heavens open; and angels came down out of heaven, and
      ministered unto them. --And there were about three hundred souls which saw and heard these
      things; and they were bid to go forth and marvel not, neither should they doubt. And it came
      to pass that they did go forth, and did minister unto the people, declaring throughout all the
      regions round about, all the things which they had heard and seen, insomuch that the more part
      of the Lamanites were convinced of them, because of the greatness of the evidencess which they
      had received; as many as were convinced, did lay down their weapons of war, and also their
      hatred, and the tradition of their fathers. And it came to ass that they did yield up unto the
      Nephites, the lands of their possession. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that when the sixty and second year of the reign of the Judges had
      ended, all these things had happened, and the Lamanites had become, the more part of them, a
      righteous people, insomuch that their righteousness did exceed that of the Nephites, because
      of their firmness, and their steadiness in faith. For behold, there were many of the Nephites
      which had become hardened, and impenitent, and grossly wicked, insomuch that they did reject
      the word of god, and all the preaching and prophecying which did come among them.
      Nevertheless, the people of the church did have great joy, because of the conversion of the
      Lamanites; yea, because of the church of God, which had been established among them. And they
      did fellowship one with another, and did rejoice one with another, and did have great joy. And
      it came to pass that many of the Lamanites did come down into the land of Zarahemla, and did
      declare unto the people of the Nephites the manner of their conversion, and did exhort them to
      faith and repentance; yea, and many did preach with exceeding great power and authority, unto
      the bringing down many of them into the depths of humility, to be humble followers of God and
      the Lamb. And it came to pass that many of the Lamanites did go into the land northward; and
      also Nephi and Lehi went into the land northward, to preach unto the people. And thus ended
      the sixty and third year. And behold, there was peace in all the land, insomuch that the
      Nephites did go into whatsoever part of the land they would, whether among the Nephites or the
      Lamanites. And it came to pass that the Lamanites did also go whithersoever they would,
      whether it were among the Lamanites or among the Nephites; and thus they did have free
      intercourse one with another, for to buy and to sell, and to get gain, according to their
      desire. And it came to pass that they became exceeding rich, both the Lamanites and the
      Nephites; and they did have exceeding plenty of gold, and of silver, and all manner of
      precious metals, both in the land south, and in the land north. Now the land south was called
      Lehi, and the land north was called Mulek, which was after the sons of Zedekiah; for the Lord
      did bring Mulek into the land north, and Lehi into the land south. And behold, there was all
      manner of gold in both these lands, and of silver, and of precious ore of every kind; and
      there was also curious workmen, which did work all kinds of ore, and did refine it; and thus
      they did become rich. They did raise grain in abundance, both in the north and in the south;
      and they did flourish exceedingly, both in the north and in the south. And they did multiply
      and wax exceeding strong in the land . And they did raise flocks and herds, yea, many
      fatlings. Behold, their women did toil and spin, and did make all manner of cloth, of fine
      twined linen, and cloth of every kind, to clothe their nakedness. And thus the sixty and
      fourth year, did pass away in peace. And in the sixty and fifth year, they did also have great
      joy and peace; yea, much preaching, and many prophecies concerning that which was to come. And
      thus passed away the sixty and fifth year. And it came to pass that in the sixty and sixth
      year of the reign of the Judges, behold, Cezoram was murdered by an unknown hand, as he sat
      upon the judgment seat. And it came to pass that in the same year, that his son, which had
      been appointed by the people in his stead, was also murdered. And thus ended the sixty and
      sixth year. And in the commencement of the sixty and seventh year, the people began to grow
      exceeding wicked again. For behold, the Lord had blessed them so long with the riches of the
      world, that they had not been stirred up to anger, to wars, nor to bloodsheds; therefore they
      began to set their hearts upon their riches; yea, they began to seek to get gain, that they
      might be lifted up one above another; therefore they began to commit secret murders, and to
      rob, and to plunder, that they might get gain. --And now behold, those murderers and
      plunderers were a band which had been formed by Kishkumen and Gadianton. And now it came to
      pass that there were many, even among the Nephites, of Gadianton's band. But behold, they were
      more numerous among the more wicked part of the Lamanites. And they were called Gadianton's
      robbers and murderers; and it was they which did murder the Chief Judge Cezoram, and his son,
      while in the judgment seat; and behold, they were not found. And now it came to pass that when
      the Lamanites found that there were robbers among them, they were exceeding sorrowful; and
      they did use every means whatsoever was in their power, to destroy them off the face of the
      earth. But behold, Satan did stir up the hearts of the more parts of the Nephites, insomuch
      that they did unite with those bands of robbers, and did enter into their covenants, and their
      oaths, that they would protect and preserve one another, in whatsoever difficult circumstances
      they should be placed in, that they should not suffer for their murders, and their
      plunderings, and their stealings. And it came to pass that they did have their signs, yea,
      their secret signs, and their secret words; and this that they might distinguish a brother who
      had entered into the covenant, that whatsoever wickedness his brothers should do, he should
      not be injured by his brother, nor by those who did belong to his band, and plunder, and
      steal, and commit whoredoms, and all manner of wickedness, contrary to the laws of their
      country, and also the laws of their God; and whosoever of those which belonged to their band,
      should reveal unto the world of their wickedness and their abominations, should be tried, not
      according to the laws of their country, but according to the laws of their wickedness, which
      had been given by Gadianton and Kishkumen. Now behold, it is these secret oaths and covenants,
      which Alma commanded his sons should not go forth unto the world, lest they should be a means
      of bringing down the people unto destruction. Now behold, those secret oaths and covenants did
      not come forth unto Gadianton from the records which were delivered unto Helaman; but behold,
      they were put into the heart of Gadianton, by that same being who did entice our first parents
      to partake of the forbidden fruit; yea, the same being who did plot with Cain, that if he
      would murder his brother Abel, it should not be known unto the world. And also it is that same
      being who put it into the hearts of the people, to build a tower sufficiently high that they
      might get to Heaven. And it was that same being which led on the people which came from that
      tower, into this land; which spread the works of darkness and abominations over all the face
      of the land, until he dragged the people down to an entire destruction, and to an everlasting
      hell; yea, it is that same being who put it into the heart of Gadianton, to still carry on the
      work of darkness, and of secret murder; and he hath brought it forth from the beginning of
      man, even down to this time. And behold, it is he which is the author of all sin. And behold,
      he doth carry on his works of darkness and secret murder, and doth hand down their plots, and
      their oaths, and their covenants, and their plans of awful wickedness, from generation to
      generation, according as he can get hold upon the hearts of the children of men. And now
      behold, he had got great hold upon the hearts of the Nephites; yea, insomuch that they had
      become exceeding wicked; yea, the more part of them had turned out of the way of
      righteousness, and did trample under their feet the commandments of God, and did turn unto
      their own ways, and did build up unto themselves idols of their gold and silver. And it came
      to pass that all these iniquities did come unto them, in the space of not many years, insomuch
      that a more part of it had come unto them in the sixty and seventh year of the reign of the
      Judges over the people of Nephi. And they did grow in their iniquities, n the sixty and eighth
      year also, to the great sorrow and lamentations of the righteous. And thus we see that the
      Nephites did begin to dwindle in unbelief, and grow in wickedness and abominations, while the
      Lamanites began to grow exceedingly in the knowledge of their God; yea, they began to keep his
      statutes and commandments, and to walk in truth and uprightness before him. And thus we see
      the spirit of the Lord began to withdraw from the Nephites, because of the wickedness and the
      hardness of their hearts. And thus we see that the Lord began to pour out his spirit upon the
      Lamanites, because of their easiness and willingness to believe in his word. And it came to
      pass that the Lamanites did hunt the band of robbers of Gadianton; and they did preach the
      word of God among the more wicked part of them, insomuch that this band of robbers was utterly
      destroyed from among the Lamanites. And it came to pass on the other hand, that the Nephites
      did build them up and support them, beginning at the more wicked part of them, until they had
      overspread all the land of the Nephites, and had seduced the more part of the righteous, until
      they had come down to believe in their works, and partake of their spoils, and to join with
      them in their secret murders and combinations. And thus they did obtain the sole management of
      the government, insomuch that they did trample under their feet, and smite, and rend, and turn
      their backs upon the poor, and the meek, and humble followers of God. And thus we see that
      they were in an awful state, and ripening for an everlasting destruction. And it came to pass
      that thus ended the sixty and eighth year of the reign of Judges over the people of Nephi.

    <text> Behold, now it came to pass in the sixty and ninth year of the reign of the Judges over
      the people of the Nephites, that Nephi, the son of Helaman, returned to the land of Zarahemla,
      from the land northward: for he had been forth among the people which was in the land
      northward, and did preach the word of God unto them, and did prophesy many things unto them;
      and they did reject all his words, insomuch that he could not stay among them, but returned
      again unto the land of his nativity; and seeing the people in a state of such awful
      wickedness, and those Gadianton robbers filling the judgment seats; having usurped the power
      and authority of the land; laying aside the commandments of God, and not in the least aright
      before him; doing no justice unto the children of men; condemning the righteous because of
      their righteousness; letting the guilty and the wicked go unpunished, bacause of their money;
      and moreover, to be held in office at the head of government, to rule and do according to
      their wills, that they might get gain and glory of the world; and moreover that they might the
      more easy commit adultery, and steal, and kill, and do according to their own wills. Now this
      great iniquity had come upon the Nephites, in the space of not many years; and when Nephi saw
      it, his heart was swollen with sorrow within his breast; and he did exclaim in the agony of
      his soul, O that I could have had my days, in the days when my father Nephi first came out of
      the land of Jerusalem, that I could have joyed with him in the promised land; then were his
      people easy to be entreated, firm to keep the commandments of God, and slow to be led to do
      iniquity; and they were quick to hearken unto the words of the Lord; yea, if my days could
      have been in them days, then would my soul have had joy in the righteousness of my brethren.
      But behold, I am consigned that these are my days, and that my soul shall be filled with
      sorrow, because of this the wickedness of my brethren. And behold, now it came to pass that it
      was upon a tower, which was in the garden of Nephi, which was by the highway which led to the
      chief market, which was in the city of Zarahemla; therefore, Nephi had bowed himself upon the
      tower which was in his garden, which tower was also near unto the garden gate which led by the
      higway. A it came to pass that there was certain men passing by, and saw Nephi as he was
      pouring out his soul unto God upon the tower, and they ran and told the people what they had
      seen; and the people came together in multitudes, that they might know the cause of so great
      mourning for the wickedness of the people. And now when Nephi arose he beheld the multitudes
      of people which had gathered together. And it came to pass that he opened his mouth and said
      unto them, Behold, why have ye gathered yourselves together? That I may tell you of your
      iniquities? Yea, because I have got upon my tower, that I might pour out my soul unto my God,
      because of the exceeding sorrow of my heart, which is because of your iniquities? And because
      of my mourning and lamentation, ye have gathered yourselves together, and do marvel; yea, and
      ye have great need to marvel; yea, ye had ought to marvel, because ye are given away, that the
      Devil hath got so great hold upon your hearts; yea, how could ye have given away to enticing
      of him, who art seeking to hurl away your souls down to everlasting misery and endless wo? O
      repent ye, repent ye! why will ye die? Turn ye, turn ye, unto the Lord your God. Why hath he
      forsaken you? It is because you have hardened your hearts; yea, ye will not hearken unto the
      voice of the good shepherd; ye have provoked him to anger against you. And behold, instead of
      gathering you, except ye will repent, behold he shall scatter you forth that ye shall become
      meat for the dogs and wild beasts. O how could you have forgotten your God in the very day
      that he hath delivered you? But behold, it is to get gain, to be praised of men; yea, and that
      ye might get gold and silver. And ye have set your hearts upon the riches and the vain things
      of this world, for the which ye do murder, and plunder, and steal, and bear false witness
      against your neighbor, and do all manner of iniquity; for this cause wo shall come unto you
      except ye shall repent. For if ye will not repent, behold this great city, and also all those
      great cities, which are round about, which are in the land of our possessions, shall be taken
      away, that ye shall have no place in them: For behold, the Lord will not grant unto you
      strength, as he hath hitherto done, to withstand against your enemies. For behold, thus saith
      the Lord: I will not shew unto the wicked of my strength, to one more than the other, save it
      be unto those who repent of their sins, and hearken unto my words; now therefore I would that
      ye should behold, my brethren, that it shall be better for the Lamanites than for you, except
      ye shall repent; for behold they are more righteous than you; for they have not sinned against
      that great knowledge which ye have received; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them;
      yea, he will lengthen out their days and increase their seed, even when thou shalt be utterly
      destroyed, except thou shalt repent; yea, wo be unto you because of that great abomination
      which hath come among you; and ye have united yourselves unto it, yea, to that secret band
      which was established by Gadianton; yea, wo shall come unto you because of that pride which ye
      have suffered to enter your hearts, which hath lifted you up beyond that which is good because
      of your exceeding great riches; yea, wo be unto you because of your wickedness and
      abominations. And except ye repent, yes shall perish; yea even your lands shall be taken from
      you, and ye shall be destroyed from off the face of the earth. Behold now I do not say that
      these things shall be, of myself, because it is not of myself that I know these things; but
      behold, I know that these things are true, because the Lord God hath made them known unto me;
      therefore I testify that they shall be. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that when Nephi had said these words, behold there were men which
      were Judges, which also belonged to the secret band of Gadianton, and they were angry, and
      they cried out against him, saying unto the people, why do ye not seize upon this man and
      bring him forth, that he may be condemned according to the crime which he hath de? Why seest
      thou this man, and hearest him revile against this people, and against our law? For behold,
      Nephi had spoken unto them concerning the corruptness of their law; yea, many things did Nephi
      speak which cannot be written; and nothing did he speak which were contrary to the
      commandments of God. And those Judges were angry with him because he spake plain unto them
      concerning their secret works of darkness; nevertheless they durst not lay their own hands
      upon him; for they feared the people, lest they should cry out against them; therefore they
      did cry unto the people, saying, Why do ye suffer this man to revile against us? For behold,
      he doth condemn all this people, even unto destruction; yea, and also that these our great
      cities shall be taken from us, that we shall have no place in them. And now we know that this
      is impossible; for behold we are powerful, and our cities great; therefore our enemies can
      have no power over us. And it came to pass that thus they did stir up the people to anger
      against Nephi, and raised contentions among them; for there were some which did cry out, Let
      this man alone, for he is a good man, and those things which he saith will surely come to pass
      except we repent; yea, behold all the judgments will come upon us which he hath testified unto
      us; for we know that he hath testified aright unto us concerning our iniquities. And behold
      they are many; and he knoweth as well as all things which shall befal us as he knoweth of our
      iniqities; yea, and behold if he had not been a prophet he could not have testified concerning
      those things. And it came to pass that those people which sought to destroy Nephi, were
      compelled because of their fear, that they did not lay their hands on him. Therefore he began
      again to speak unto them, seeing that he had gained favor in the eyes of some, insomuch that
      the remainder of them did fear. Therefore he was constrained to speak more unto them, saying:
      Behold my brethren, have ye not read that God gave power unto one man, even Moses, to smite
      upon the waters of the Red Sea, and they parted hither and thither, insomuch that the
      Israelites, which were our fathers, came through upon dry ground, and the waters closed upon
      the armies of the Egyptians, and swallowed them up? And now behold, if God gave unto this man
      such power, then why should ye dispute among yourselves, and say that he hath given unto me no
      power whereby I may know concerning the judgments that shall come upon you except ye repent?
      But behold, ye not only deny my words, but ye also deny all the words which hath been spoken
      by our fathers, and also the words which was spoken by this man, Moses, which had such great
      power given unto him; yea, the words which he hath spoken concerning the coming of the
      Messiah. Yea, did he not bear record, that the Son of God should come? --And as he lifted up
      the brazen serpent in the wilderness, even so shall he be lifted up which should come. And as
      many as should look upon the serpent should live, even so as many as should look upon the Son
      of God, with faith, having a contrite spirit, might live, even unto that life which is
      eternal. --And now behold, Moses did not only testify of these things, but also all the holy
      prophets, from his day even to the days of Abraham. Yea, and behold, Abraham saw of his
      coming, and was filled with gladness, and did rejoice. Yea, and behold I say unto you, That
      Abraham not only knew of these things, but there were many before the days of Abraham which
      were called by the order of God; yea, even after the order of his Son; and this that it should
      be shewn unto the people of a great many thousand years before his coming, that even
      redemption should come unto them. And now I would that ye should know, that even since the
      days of Abraham, there hath been many prophets that hath testified these things; yea, behold,
      the prophet Zenas did testify boldly; for the which he was slain. And behold, also Zenoch, and
      also Ezias, and also Isaiah, and Jeremiah, (Jeremiah being that same prophet which testified
      of the destruction of Jerusalem.) And now we know that Jerusalem was destroyed, according to
      the words of Jeremiah. O then why not the Son of God come, according to his prophecy? And now
      will ye dispute that Jerusalem was destroyed? Will ye say that the sons of Zedekiah were not
      slain, all except it were Mulek? Yea, and do ye not behold that the seed of Zedekiah are with
      us, and that they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem? But behold, this is not all. Our
      father Lehi was driven out of Jerusalem, because he testified of these things. Nephi also
      testified of these things, and also almost all of our fathers, even down to this time; yea,
      they have testified of the coming of Christ, and have looked forward, and have rejoiced in his
      day which is to come. And behold, he is God, and he is with them, and he did manifest himself
      unto them, that they were redeemed by him; and they gave unto him glory, because of that which
      is to come. And now seeing ye know these things, and cannot deny them, except ye shall lie,
      therefore in this ye have sinned, for ye have rejected all these things, notwithstanding so
      many evidences which ye have received; yea, even ye have received all things, both things in
      Heaven, and all things which are in the earth, as a witness that they are true. But behold, ye
      have rejected the truth, and rebelled against your holy God; and even at this time, instead of
      laying up for yourselves treusures in Heaven, where nothing doth corrupt, and where nothing
      can come which is unclean, ye are heaping up for yourselves wrath against the day of judgment;
      yea, even at this time ye are ripening, because of your murders, and your fornication and
      wickedness, for everlasting destruction; yea, and except ye repent, it will come unto you
      soon; yea, behold it is now even at your doors; yea, go ye unto the judgment seat, and search;
      and behold, your Judge is murdered, and he lieth in his blood; and he ,hath been murdered by
      his brother, who seeketh to sit in the judgment seat. And behold, they both belong to your
      secret band, whose author is Gadianton, and the evil one which seeketh to destroy the souls of
      men. </text>

    <text> Behold now it came to pass that when Nephi had spoken these words, certain men which were
      among them ran to the judgment seat; yea, even there were five which went; and they said among
      themselves, as they went, Behold, we will know of a surety, whether this man be a prophet, and
      God hath commanded him to prophesy such marvellous things unto us. Behold we do not believe
      that he hath; yea, we do not believe that he is a prophet; nevertheless, if this thing which
      he hath said concerning the Chief Judge be true, that he be dead, then we will believe that
      the other words which he hath spoken is true. And it came to pass that they ran in their
      might, and came in unto the judgment seat; and behold the Chief Judge had fallen to the earth,
      and did lie in his blood. And now behold, when they saw this, they were astonished
      exceedingly, insomuch that they fell to the earth; for they had not believed the words which
      Nephi had spoken concerning the Chief Judge; but now when they saw they believed, and fear
      came upon them, lest all the judgments which Nephi had spoken should come upon the people;
      therefore they did quake, and had fallen to the earth. Now immediately when the Judge had been
      murdered: he being stabbed by his brother, by a garb of secrecy; and he fled, and the servants
      ran and told the people, raising the cry of murder among them. And behold the people did
      gather themselves together unto the place of the judgment seat; and behold, to their
      astonishment, they saw those five men which had fallen to the earth. And now behold, the
      people knew nothing concerning the ,multitude which had gathered together at the garden of
      Nephi; therefore they said among themselves, These men are they which have murdered the Judge,
      and God hath smitten them that they could not flee from us. And it came to pass that they laid
      ho on them, and bound them, and cast them into prison. And there was a proclamation sent
      abroad that the Judge was slain, and that the murderers had been taken, and was cast into
      prison. And it came to pass that on the morrow, the people did assemble themselves together to
      mourn and to fast, at the burial of the great and Chief Judge, which had been slain. And thus
      were also those Judges which were at the garden of Nephi, and heard his words, were also
      gathered together at the burial. And it came to pass that they inquired among the people,
      saying, Where are the five which was sent to inquire concerning the Chief Judge whether he was
      dead? And they answered and said, Concerning this five which ye say ye have sent, we know not;
      but there are five, which are the murderers, whom we have cast into prison. And it came to
      pass that the Judges desired that they should be brought; and they were brought, and behold
      they were the five which were sent; and behold the Judges inquired of them to know concerning
      the matter, and they told them all that they had done, saying, We ran and came to the place of
      the judgment, and when we saw all things, even as Nephi had testified, we were astonished,
      insomuch that we fell to the earth; and when we were recovered from our astonishment, behold
      they cast us into prison. Now as for the murder of this man, we know not who hath done it, and
      only this much we know, we ran and came according as ye desired, and behold he was dead
      according to the words of Nephi. And now it came to pass that the Judge did expound the matter
      unto the people, and did cry out against Nephi, saying, Behold we know that this Nephi must
      have agreed with some one to slay the Judge, and then he might declare it unto us, that he
      might convert us unto his faith, that he might raise himself to be a great man, chosen of God,
      and a prophet; and now behold we will detect this man, and he shall confess his fault and make
      known unto us the true murderer of this Judge. And it came to pass that the five were
      liberated on the day of the burial. Nevertheless, they did rebuke the Judges in the words
      which they had spoken against Nephi, and did contend with them one by one, insomuch that they
      did confound them. Nevertheless, they caused that Nephi should be taken and bound and brought
      before the multitude, and they began to question him in divers ways, that they might cross
      him, that they might accuse him to death; saying unto him, Thou art confederate; who is this
      man that hath done this murder? Now tell us, and acknowledge thy fault, saying, Behold here is
      money; and also we will grant unto thee thy life if thou wilt tell us and acknowledge the
      agreement, which thou hast made with him. But Nephi saith unto them, O ye fools, ye
      uncircumsised of heart, ye blind, and ye stiff-necked people, do ye know how long the Lord
      your God will suffer you that ye shall go on this your ways of sin? O ye had ought to begin to
      howl and mourn, because of the great destruction at this time which doth await you, except ye
      shall repent. Behold, ye say that I have agreed with a man, that he should murder Seezoram,
      our Chief Judge. But behold, I say unto you, that this is because I have testified unto you,
      that ye might know concerning this thing; yea, even for a witness unto you, that I did know of
      the wickedness and abominations which is among you. And because I have done this, ye say that
      I have agreed with a man that he should do this thing; yea, because I shewed unto you this
      sign, ye are angry with me, and seek to destroy my life. And now behold, I will shew unto you
      another sign, and see if ye will in this thing seek to destroy me. Behold I say unto you, Go
      to the house of Seantum, which is the brother of Seezoram, and say unto him, Hath Nephi, the
      pretended prophet, which doth prophesy so much evil concerning this people, agreed with thee,
      in the which ye have murdered Seezoram, which is your brother? And behold, he shall say unto
      you, Nay. And ye shall say unto him, Have ye murdered your brother? And he shall stand with
      fear, and wist not what to say. And behold, he shall deny unto you; and he shall make as if he
      were astonished; nevertheless, he shall declare unto you that he is innocent. But behold, ye
      shall examine him, and ye shall find blood upon the skirts of his cloak. And when ye have seen
      this, ye shall say, From whence cometh this blood? Do we not know that it is the blood of your
      brother? And then he shall tremble, and shall look pale, even as if death had come upon him.
      And then shall ye say, Because of this fear and this paleness which hath come upon your face,
      behold, we know that thou art guilty. And then shall greater fear come upon him; and then
      shall he confess unto you, and deny no more that he hath done this murder. And then shall he
      say unto you, That I, Nephi, know nothing concerning the matter, save it were given unto me by
      the power of God. And then shall ye know that I am an honest man, and that I am sent unto you
      from God. And it came to pass that they went and did, even according as Nephi had said unto
      them. And behold, the words which he had said, were true: for according to the words, he did
      deny; and also according to the words, he did confess. And he was brought to prove that he
      himself was the very murderer, insomuch that the five were set at liberty; and also was Nephi.
      And there were some of the Nephites which believed on the words of Nephi; and there were some
      also, which believed, because of the testimony of the five, for they had been converted while
      they were in prison. And now there were some among the people, which said that Nephi was a
      prophet; and there were others which said, Behold, he is a god, for except he was a god, he
      could not know of all things. For behold, he hath told us the thoughts of our hearts, and also
      hath told us things; and even he hath brought unto our knowledge the true murderer of our
      Chief Judge. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that there arose a division among the people, insomuch that they
      divided hither and thither, and went their ways, leaving Nephi alone, as he was standing in
      the midst of them. And it came to pass that Nephi went his way towards his own house,
      pondering upon the things which the Lord had shewn unto him. And it came to pass as he was
      pondering, --being much cast down because of the wickedness of the people of the Nephites,
      their secret works of darkness, and their murderings, and their plunderings, and all manner of
      iniquities --and it came to pass as he was thus pondering in his heart, behold, a voice came
      unto him, saying: Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done: for I have
      beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word which I have given unto thee, unto
      this people. And thou hast not feared them, and hast not sought thine own life, but hath
      sought my will, and to keep my commandments. And now because thou hast done this with such
      unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in
      deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to
      thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will. Behold, thou art Nephi,
      and I am God. Behold, I declare it unto thee in the presence of mine angles, that ye shall
      have power over this people, and shall smite the earth with famine, and with pestilence, and
      destruction, according to the wickedness of this people. Behold, I give unto you power, that
      whatsoever ye shall seal on earth, shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on
      earth, shall be loosed in heaven; and thus shall ye have power among this people. And thus, if
      ye shall say unto this temple, It shall be rent in twain, and it shall be done. And if ye
      shall say unto this mountain, Be thou cast down and become smooth, and it shall be done. And
      behold, if ye shall say, That God shall smite this people, it shall come to pass. --And now
      behold, I command you that ye shall go and declare unto this people, that thus saith the Lord
      God, who is the almighty: Except ye repent, ye shall be smitten, even unto destruction. And
      behold, now it came to pass that when the Lord had spoken these words unto Nephi, he did stop,
      and did not go unto his house, but did return unto the multitudes which were scattered about
      upon the face of the land, and began to declare unto them the word of the Lord, which had been
      spoken unto him concerning their destruction, if they did not repent. Now behold,
      notwithstanding that great miracle which Nephi had done in telling them concerning the death
      of the Chief Judge, they did harden their hearts, and did not hearken unto the words of the
      Lord; therefore Nephi did declare unto them the words of the Lord, saying: Except ye repent,
      thus saith the Lord: Ye shall be smitten even unto destruction. --And it came to pass that
      when Nephi had declared unto them the word, behold, they did still harden their hearts, and
      would not hearken unto his words; therefore they did revile against him, and did seek to lay
      their hands upon him, that they might cast him into prison. But behold, the power of God was
      with him, and they could not take him to cast him into prison: for he was taken by the spirit,
      and conveyed out of the midst of them. And it came to pass that thus he did go forth in the
      spirit, from multitude to multitude, declaring the word of God, even until he had declared it
      unto them all, or sent it forth among all the people. And it came to pass that they would not
      hearken unto his words; and there began to be contentions, insomuch that they were divided
      against themselves, and began to slay one another with the sword. And thus ended the seventy
      and first year of the reign of Judges over the people of Nephi. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass in the seventy and second year of the reign of the Judges, that
      contentions did increase, insomuch that there were wars throughout all the land, among all the
      people of Nephi. And it was this secret band of robbers which did carry on this work of
      destruction and wickedness. And this war did last all that year. And in the seventy and third
      year it did also last. And it came to pass that in this year, Nephi did cry unto the Lord,
      saying: O Lord, do not suffer that this people shall be destroyed by the sword; but O Lord,
      rather let there be a famine in the land, to stir them up in remembrance of the Lord their
      God, and perhaps they will repent and turn unto thee; and so it was done, according to the
      words of Nephi. --And there was a great famine upon the land, among all the people of Nephi.
      And thus, in the seventy and fourth year, the famine did continue, and the work of destruction
      did cease by the sword, but became sore by famine. And this work of destruction did also
      continue in the seventy and fifth year. For the earth was smitten, that it was dry, and did
      not yield forth grain in the season of grain; and the whole earth was smitten, even among the
      Lamanites as well as among the Nephites, so that they were smitten that they did perish by
      thousands, in the more wicked parts of the land. And it came to pass that the people saw that
      they were about to perish by famine, and they began to remember the Lord their God; and they
      began to remember the words of Nephi. And the people began to plead with their Chief Judges
      and their leaders, that they would say unto Nephi, Behold, we know that thou art a man of God,
      and therefore cry unto the Lord our God, that he turn away from us this famine, lest all the
      words which thou hast spoken concerning our destruction, be fulfilled. And it came to pass
      that the Judges did say unto Nephi, according to the words which had been desired. --And it
      came to pass that when Nephi saw that the people had repented, and did humble themselves in
      sackcloth, he cried again unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, behold this people repenteth; and
      they have swept away the band of Gadianton from amongst them, insomuch that they have become
      extinct, and they have concealed their secret plans in the earth. Now, O Lord, because of this
      their humility, wilt thou turn away thine anger, and let thine anger be appeased in the
      destruction of those wicked men whom thou hast already destroyed? O Lord, wilt thou turn away
      thine anger, yea, thy fierce anger, and cause that this famine may cease in this land? O Lord,
      wilt thou hearken unto me, and cause that it may be done according to my words, and send forth
      rain upon the face of the earth, that she may bring forth her fruit and her grain, in the
      season of grain? O Lord, thou didst hearken unto my words when I said, Let there be a famine,
      that the pestilence of the sword might cease; and I know that thou wilt, even at this time,
      hearken unto my words: for thou saidst, That if this people repent, I will spare them; yea, O
      Lord, and thou seest that they have repented, because of the famine, and the pestilence and
      destruction which has come upon them. And now, O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, and
      try again if they will serve thee? And if so, O Lord, thou canst bless them according to thy
      words which thou hast said. And it came to pass that in the seventy and sixth year, the Lord
      did turn away his anger from the people, and caused that rain should fall upon the earth,
      insomuch that it did bring forth her fruit in the season of her fruit. And it came to pass
      that it did bring forth her grain, in the season of her grain. And behold, the people did
      rejoice, and glorify God; and the whole face of the land was filled with rejoicing; and they
      did no more seek to destroy Nephi, but they did esteem him as a great prophet, and a man of
      God, having great power and authority given unto him from God. And behold, Lehi, his brother,
      was not a whit behind him as to things pertaining to righteousness. And thus it did come to
      pass that the people of Nephi began to prosper again in the land, and began to build up their
      waste places, and began to multiply and spread, even until they did cover the whole face of
      the land, both on the northward and on the southward, from the sea west, to the sea east. And
      it came to pass that the seventy and sixth year did end in peace. And the seventy and seventh
      year began in peace; and the church did spread throughout the face of all the land; and the
      more part of the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, did belong to the church; and
      they did have exceeding great peace in the land. And thus ended the seventy and seventh year.
      And also they had peace in the seventy and eighth year, save it were a few contentions
      concerning the points of doctrine which had been laid down by the prophets. And in the seventy
      and ninth year, there began to be much strife. But it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi, and
      many of their brethren, which knew concerning the true points of doctrine, having many
      revelations daily, therefore they did preach unto the people, insomuch that they did put and
      end to their strife in that same year. And it came to pass that in the eightieth year of the
      reign of the Judges over the people of Nephi, there was a certain number of the dissenters
      from the people of Nephi, which had some years before gone over unto the Lamanites, and took
      upon themselves the name of Lamanites; and also, a certain number which were real descendants
      of the Lamanites, being stirred up to anger by them, or by those dissenters, therefore they
      commenced a war with their brethren. And they did commit murder and plunder; and then they
      would retreat back into the mountains, and into the wilderness and secret places, hiding
      themselves that they could not be discovered, receiving daily an addition to their numbers,
      inasmuch as there were dissenters that went forth unto them; and thus in time, yea, even in
      the space of not many years, they became an exceeding great band of robbers; and they did
      search out all the secret plans of Gadianton; and thus they became robbers of Gadianton. Now
      behold, these robbers did make great havoc, yea, even great destruction among the people of
      Nephi, and also among the people of the Lamanites. And it came to pass that it was expedient
      that there should be a stop put to this work of destruction; therefore they sent an army of
      strong men into the wilderness, and upon the mountains, to search out this band of robbers,
      and to destroy them. But behold, it came to pass that in the same year, they were driven back
      even into their own lands. And thus ended the eightieth year of the reign of the Judges over
      the people of Nephi. And it came to pass in the commencement of the eighty and first year,
      they did go forth again against this band of robbers, and did destroy many; and they were also
      visited with much destruction; and they were again obliged to return out of the wilderness,
      and out of the mountains, unto their own lands, because of the exceeding greatness of the
      numbers of those robbers which infested the mountains and the wilderness. --And it came to
      pass that thus ended this year. And the robbers did still increase and wax strong, inasmuch
      that they did defy the whole armies of the Nephites, and also of the Lamanites; and they did
      cause great fear to come unto the people, upon all the face of the land, yea, for they did
      visit many parts of the land, and did do great destruction unto them; yea, did kill many, and
      did carry away others captive into the wilderness; yea, and more especially their women and
      their children. Now this great evil, which came unto the people because of their iniquity, did
      stir them up in remembrance of the Lord their God. And thus ended the eighty and first year of
      the reign of the Judges. And in the eighty and second year, they began again to forget the
      Lord their God. And in the eighty and third year, they began to wax strong in iniquity. --And
      in the eighty and fourth year, they did not mend their ways. And it came to pass in the eighty
      and fifth year, they did wax stronger and stronger in their pride, and in their wickedness;
      and thus they were ripening again for destruction. And thus ended the eighty and fifth year.

    <text> And thus we can behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of the hearts of the children
      of men; yea, we can see that the Lord in his great infinite goodness, doth bless and prosper
      those who put their trust in him; yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper
      his people; yea, in the increase of their fields, their flocks, and their herds, and in gold,
      and in silver, and in all manner of precious things of every kind and art; sparing their
      lives, and delivering them out of the hands of their enemies; softening the hearts of their
      enemies, that they should not declare wars against them; yea, and in fine, doing all things
      for the welfare and happiness of his people; yea, then is the time that they do harden their
      hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do trample under their feet the Holy One; yea,
      and this because of their ease, and their exceeding great prosperity. And thus we see, that
      except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, yea, except he doth visit them
      with death, and with terror, and with famine, and with all manner of pestilence, they will not
      remember him. O how foolish, and how vain, and how evil, and devlish, and how quick to do
      iniquity, and how slow to do good, are the children of men; yea, how quick to hearken unto the
      words of the evil one, and to set their hearts upon the vain things of the world; yea, how
      quick to be lifted up in pride; yea, how quick to boast, and do all manner of that which is
      iniquity; and how slow are they to remember the Lord their God, and to give ear unto his
      counsels; yea, how slow to walk in wisdom's path! Behold, they do not desire that the Lord
      their God, who hath created them, should rule and reign over them, notwithstanding his great
      goodness and his mercy towards them; they do set at nought his counsels, and they will not
      that he should be their guide. O how great is the nothingness of the children of the men; yea,
      even they are less than dust of the earth. For behold, the dust of the earth moveth hither and
      thither, the dividing asunder, at the command of our great and everlasting God; yea, behold,
      at his voice doth the hills and mountains tremble and quake; and by the power of his voice,
      they are broken up and become smooth, yea, even like unto a valley; yea, by the power of his
      voice, doth the whole earth shake; yea, by the power of his voice, doth the foundations rock,
      even to the very centre; yea, and if he saith unto the earth, Move, and it is moved; yea, if
      he saith unto the earth, Thou shalt go back, that it lengthen out the day for many hours, and
      it is done; and thus according to his word, the earth goeth back, and it appeareth unto man
      that the sun standeth still; yea, and behold, this is so; for sure it is the earth that
      moveth, and not the sun. And behold, also, if he saith unto the waters of the great deep, Be
      thou dried up, and it is done. Behold, if he saith unto this mountain, Be thou raised up, and
      come over and fall upon that city, that it be buried up, and behold it is done. And behold, if
      a man hideth up a treasure in the earth, and the Lord shall say, Let it be accursed, because
      of the iniquity of him that hath hid it up, behold, it shall be accursed; and if the Lord
      shall say, Be thou accursed, that no man shall find thee from this time henceforth and
      forever, and behold, no man getteth it henceforth and forever. And behold, if the Lord shall
      say unto a man, Because of thine iniquities thou shalt be accursed forever, and it shall be
      done. And if the Lord shall say, Because of thine iniquities, thou shalt be cut off from my
      presence, and he will cause that it shall be so. --And wo unto whom he shall say this, for it
      shall be unto him that will do iniquity, and he cannot be saved; therefore, for this cause,
      that men might be saved, hath repentance been declared. Therefore, blessed are they who will
      repent, and hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God; for these are they that shall be
      saved. And may God grant, in his great fulness, that men might be brought unto repentance and
      good works, that they might be restored unto grace, for grace according to their works. And I
      would that all men might be saved. But we read that in that great and last day, there are some
      which shall be cast out; yea, which shall be cast off from the presence of the Lord; yea,
      which shall be consigned to the state of endless misery, fulfilling the words which saith,
      That they have done good, shall have everlasting life; and they that have done evil, shall
      have everlasting damnation. --And thus it is. Amen. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass in the eighty and sixth year, the Nephites did still remain in
      wickedness, yea, in great wickedness, while the Lamanites did observe strictly to keep the
      commandments of God, according to the law of Moses. And it came to pass that in this year,
      there was one Samuel, a Lamanite, came into the land of Zarahemla, and began to preach unto
      the people. And it came to pass that he did preach many-day repentance unto the people, and
      they did cast him out, and he was about to return to his own land. But behold, the voice of
      the Lord came unto him, that he should return again, and prophesy unto the people whatsoever
      things should come in his heart. And it came to pass that they would not suffer that he should
      enter into the city; therefore he went and got upon the wall thereof, and stretched forth his
      hand and cried with a loud voice, and prophesied unto the people whatsoever things the Lord
      put into his heart; and he said unto them. Behold, I, Samuel, a Lamanite, do speak the words
      of the Lord, which he doth put into my heart; and behold he hath put it into my heart to say
      unto this people, that the sword of justice hangeth over this people; and four hundred years
      passeth not away save the sword of justice falleth upon this people; yea, heavy destruction
      awaiteth this people, and it surely cometh unto this people, and nothing can save this people,
      save it be repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ, which surely shall come into the
      world, and shall suffer many things, and shall be slain for his people. And behold, an angel
      of the Lord hath declared it unto me, and he did bring glad tidings to my soul. And behold, I
      was sent unto you to declare it unto you also, that ye might have glad tidings; but behold ye
      would not receive me, therefore thus saith the Lord, Because of the hardness of the hearts of
      the people of the Nephites, except they repent I will take away my word from them, and I will
      withdraw my spirit from them, and I will suffer them no longer, and I will turn the hearts of
      their brethren against them; and four hundred years shall not pass away, before I will cause
      that they shall be smitten; yea, I will visit them with the sword, and with famine, and with
      pestilence; yea, I will visit them in my fierce anger, and there shall be those of the fourth
      generation, which shall live, of your enemies, to behold your utter destruction; and this
      shall surely come, except ye repent, saith the Lord; and those of the fourth generation shall
      visit your destruction. But if ye will repent and return unto the Lord your God, I will turn
      away mine anger saith the Lord,; yea, thus saith the Lord, Blessed are they who will repent
      and turn unto me, but wo unto him that repenteth not; yea, wo unto this great city of
      Zarahemla; for behold it is because of they which are righteous, that it is saved; yea, wo
      unto this great city, For I perceive, saith the Lord, that there are many, yea, even the more
      part of this great city, that will harden their hearts against me, saith the Lord. But blessed
      are they who will repent, for them will I spare. But behold if it were not for the righteous
      which are in this great city, behold I would cause that fire should come down out of heaven,
      and destroy it. But behold, it is for the righteous' sake, that it is spared. But behold, the
      time cometh, saith the Lord, that when ye shall be cast out the righteous among you, then
      shall ye be ripe for destruction; yea, wo be unto this great city, because of the wickedness
      and abominations which is in her; yea, and wo be unto the city of Gideon, for the wickedness
      and abominations which is in her; yea, and wo be unto all the cities which are in the land
      round about, which is possessed by the Nephites, because of the wickedness and abominations
      which is in them; and behold, a curse shall come upon the land, saith the Lord of Hosts,
      because of the people's sake which is upon the land; yea, because of their wickedness and
      their abominations. And it shall come to pass, saith the Lord of Hosts, yea, our great and
      true God, that whoso shall hide up treasures in the earth, shall find them again no more,
      because of the great curse of the land , save he be a righteous man, and shall hide it up unto
      the Lord: For I will saith the Lord, that they shall hide up their treasures unto me; and
      cursed be they who hideth not up their treasures unto me; for non hideth up their treasures
      unto me save it be the righteous; and he that hideth not up his treasure unto me, cursed is
      he, and also the treasure, and none shall redeem it because of the curse of the land. And the
      day shall come that they shall hide up their treasures, because they have set their hearts
      upon riches; and because they have set their hearts upon their riches, I will hide up their
      treasures when they shall flee before their enemies, because they will not hide them up unto
      me; cursed be they, and also their treasures; and in that day shall they be smitten, saith the
      Lord. Behold ye, the people of this great city, and hearken unto my words; yea, hearken unto
      the words which the Lord saith; for behold, he saith that ye are cursed because of your
      riches, and also are your riches cursed because ye have set your hearts upon them, and hath
      not hearkened unto the words of him who gave them unto you. Ye do not remember the Lord your
      God in the things which he hath blessed you, but ye do always remember your riches, not to
      thank the Lord your God for them; yea, your heart is not drawn out unto the Lord, but they do
      swell with great pride, unto boasting, and unto great swelling, envyings, strifes, malice,
      persecutions, and murders, and all manner of iniquities: For this cause hath the Lord God
      caused that a curse should come upon the land, and also upon your riches; and this because of
      your iniquities; yea, wo unto this people, because of this time which has arriven, that ye do
      cast out the prophets, and do mock them, and cast stones at them, and do slay them, and do all
      manner of iniquity unto them, even as they did of old time. And now when ye talk, ye say, If
      our days had been in the days of our fathers of old, ye would not have slain the prophets; ye
      would not have stoned them, and cast them out. Behold ye are worse than they; for as the Lord
      liveth, if a prophet come among you. and declareth unto you the word of the Lord, which
      testifieth of your sins and iniquities, ye are angry with him, and cast him out, and seek all
      manner of ways to destroy him; yea, you will say that he is a false prophet, and that he is a
      sinner, and of the Devil, because he testifieth that your deeds are evil. But behold, if a man
      shall come among you, and shall say, Do this, and there is no iniquity; do that, and ye shall
      suffer; yea, he will say, walk after the pride of your own hearts; yea, walk after the pride
      of your eyes, and do whatsoever your heart desireth; and if a man shall come among you and say
      this, ye will receive him, and ye shall say that he is a prophet; yea, ye will lift him up,
      and ye will give unto him of your substance; ye will give unto him of your gold, and of your
      silver, and ye will clothe him with costly apparel; and because he speaketh flattering words
      unto you, and he saith that all is well, and then ye will not find fault with him. O ye wicked
      and ye perverse generation; ye hardened and stiffnecked people, how long will ye suppose that
      the Lord will suffer you; yea, how long will ye suffer yourselves to be lead by foolish and
      blind guides; yea, how long will ye choose darkness rather than light; yea, behold the anger
      of the Lord is already kindled against you; behold, he hath cursed the land, because of your
      iniquity; and behold, the time cometh that he curseth your riches, that it becometh slippery,
      that ye cannot hold them; and in the days of your poverty, ye shall cry unto the Lord; and in
      vain shall ye cry, for your desolation is already come upon you, and your destruction is made
      sure; and then shall ye weep and howl in that day, saith the Lord of Hosts. And then shall ye
      lament, and say, O Lord I had repented, and had not killed the prophets, and stoned them, and
      cast them out; yea, in that day shall ye say, O that we had remembered the Lord our God, in
      the day he gave us our riches, and then they would not have become slippery, and that we
      should lose them; for behold, our riches are gone from us. Behold, we layeth a tool here, and
      on the morrow it is gone; and behold, our swords are taken from us in the day we have sought
      them for battle. Yea, we have hid up our treasures, and they have slipped away from us,
      because of the curse of the land. O that we had repented in the day that the word of the Lord
      came upon us; for behold, the land is cursed, and all things are become slippery, and we
      cannot hold them. Behold we are surrounded by demons, yea, we are encircled about by the
      angels of him who hath sought to destroy our souls. Behold, our iniquities are great. O Lord,
      canst thou turn away thine anger from us? And this shall be your language in them days. But
      behold, your days of probation is past; ye have procrastinated the day of your salvation,
      until it is everlasting too late, and your destruction is made sure; yea, for ye have sought
      all the days of your lives for that which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for
      happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which
      is in our great and Eternal Head. O ye people of the land, that ye would hear my words. And I
      pray that t anger of the Lord be turned away from you, and that ye would repent and be saved.

    <text> And now it came to pass that Samuel, the Lamanite, did prophesy a great many more things
      which cannot be written. And behold, he saith unto them, Behold, I give unto you a sign: for
      five years more cometh, and behold, then cometh the son of God to redeem all those who shall
      believe on his name. And behold, this will I give unto you for a sign at the time of his
      coming; for behold, there shall be great lights in Heaven, insomuch that in the night before
      he cometh, there shall be no darkness, insomuch that it shall appear unto man as it is day;
      therefore there shall be one day and a night, and a day, as if it were one day, and there were
      no night; and this shall be unto you for a sign; for ye shall know of the rising of the sun,
      and also of its setting; therefore they shall know of a surety that there shall be two days
      and a night; nevertheless the night shall be darkened; and it shall be night before he is
      born. And behold there shall a new star arise, such an one as ye never have beheld; and this
      also shall be a sign unto you. And behold this is not all: there shall be many signs and
      wonders in Heaven. And it shall come to pass that ye shall be amazed, and wonder, insomuch
      that ye shall fall to the earth. And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall believe on the
      Son of God, the same shall have everlasting life. And behold, thus saith the Lord commanded
      me, by his angel, that I should come and tell this thing unto you; yea, he hath commanded that
      I should prophesy these things unto you; yea, he hath said unto me, Cry unto this people,
      repent and prepare the ways of the Lord. And now because I am a Lamanite, and hath spoken unto
      you the words which the Lord hath commanded me, and because it was hard against you, ye are
      angry with me, and do seek to destroy me, and have cast me out from among you. And ye shall
      hear my words, for, for this intent I have come up upon the walls of this city, that ye might
      hear and know of the judgments of God which doth await you because of your iniquities, and
      also that ye might know the conditions of repentance; and also that ye might know of the
      coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of Heaven and of earth, the Creator of all
      things, from the beginning; and that ye might know of his coming, to the intent that ye might
      believe on his name. And if ye believe on his name, ye will repent of all your sins, that
      thereby ye may have a remission of them through his merits. And behold, again another sign I
      give unto you; yea, a sign of his death; for behold, he surely must die, that salvation may
      come; yea, it behooveth him, and becometh expedient that he dieth, to bring to pass the
      resurrection of the dead, that thereby man may be brought into the presence of the Lord; yea,
      behold this death bringeth to pass the resurrection, and redeemeth all mankind from the first
      death; that spiritual death for all mankind, by the fall of Adam, being cut off from the
      presence of the Lord, are considered as dead, both as to things temporal and to things
      spiritual. But behold, the resurrection of Christ redeemeth mankind, yea, even all mankind,
      and bringeth them back into the presence of the Lord; yea, it bringeth to pass the condition
      of repentance, that whosoever repenteth, the same is not hewn down and cast into the fire; but
      whosoever repenteth not, is hewn down and cast into the fire, and there cometh upon them again
      a spiritual death, yea, a second death, for they are cut off again as to things pertaining to
      righteousness; therefore repent ye, lest by knowing these things and not doing them, ye shall
      suffer yourselves to come under condemnation, and ye are brought down unto this second death.
      But behold, as I said unto you concerning another sign, a sign of his death: behold, in that
      day that he shall suffer death, the sun shall be darkened and refuse to give his light unto
      you; and also the moon, and the stars; and there shall be no light upon he face of this land,
      even from the time that he shall suffer death, for the space of three days, to the time that
      he shall rise again from the dead; yea, at the time that he shall yield up the ghost, there
      shall be thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours, and the earth shall quake and
      tremble, and the rocks which is upon the face of this earth, which is both above the earth and
      beneath, which ye know at this time is solid, or the more part of it is one solid mass, shall
      be broken up; yea, they shall be rent in twain, and shall ever after be found in seams, and in
      cracks, and in broken fragments upon the face of the whole earth; yea, both above the earth
      and both beneath. And behold, there shall be great tempests, and there shall be many mountains
      laid low, like unto a valley, and there shall be many places, which are now called valleys,
      which shall become mountains, whose height thereof is great. And many highways shall be broken
      up, and many cities shall become desolate, and many graves shall be opened, and shall yield up
      many of their dead; and many saints shall appear unto many. And behold thus hath the angel
      spoken unto me; for he said unto me, That there should be thunderings and lightnings for the
      space of many hours; and he said unto me that while the thunder and the lightning lasted, and
      the tempest, that these things should be, and that darkness should cover the face of the whole
      earth, for the space of three days. And the angel said unto me that many shall see greater
      things than these, to the intent that they might believe that these signs and these wonders
      should come to pass, upon all the face of this land; to the intent that there should be no
      cause for unbelief among the children of men; and this to the intent that whosoever will
      believe, might be saved, and that whosoever will not believe, a righteous judgment might come
      upon them; and also if they are condemned, they bring upon themselves their own condemnation.
      And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and
      whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself; for behold ye are free; ye are permitted to
      act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge, and he hath made you
      free; he hath given unto you that ye might know good from evil, and he hath given unto you
      that ye might choose life or death, and ye can do good and be restored unto that which is
      good, or have that which is good restored unto you; or ye can do evil, and have that which is
      evil restored unto you. </text>

    <text> And now my beloved brethren, behold, I declare unto you that except ye shall repent, your
      houses shall be left unto you desolate; yea, except ye repent, your women shall have great
      cause to mourn in the day that they shall give suck; for ye shall attempt to flee, and there
      shall be no place for refuge; and wo unto them which are with child, for they shall be heavy,
      and cannot flee; therefore they shall be trodden down, and shall be left to perish; yea, wo
      unto this people which are called the people of Nephi, except they shall repent when they
      shall see all those signs and wonders which shall be showed unto them; for behold, they have
      been a chosen people of the Lord; yea, the people of Nephi hath he loved, and also hath he
      chastened them; yea, in the days of their iniquities hath he chastened them, because he loveth
      them. But behold my brethren, the Lamanites hath he hated, because their deeds have been evil
      continually; and this because of the iniquity of the tradition of their fathers. But behold,
      salvation hath come unto them, through the preaching of the Nephites; and for this intent hath
      the Lord prolonged their days. And I would that ye should behold that the more part of them
      are in the path of their duty, and they do walk circumspectly before God, and they do observe
      to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, according to the law of Moses.
      Yea, I say unto you, that the more part of them are doing this, and they are string, with
      unwearied diligence, that they may bring the remainder of their brethren to the knowledge of
      the truth; therefore there are many which add to their numbers daily. And behold ye do know of
      yourselves, for ye have witnessed it, that as many of them as are brought to the knowledge of
      the truth, and to know of the wicked and abominable traditions of their fathers, and are led
      to believe the Holy Scriptures, yea, the prophecies of the holy prophets, which are written,
      which leadeth them to faith on the Lord, and unto repentance, which faith and repentance
      bringeth a change of heart unto them, therefore as many as have come to this, ye know of
      yourselve, are firm and steadfast in the faith, and in the thing wherewith they have been made
      free. --And ye know also that they have buried their weapons of war, and they fear to take
      them up lest by any means they shall sin; yea, ye can see that they fear to sin; for behold,
      they will suffer themselves that they be trodden down and slain by their enemies, and will not
      lift their swords against them; and this because of their faith in Christ. And now because of
      their steadfastness when they do believe in that thing which they do believe; for because of
      their firmness when they are once enlightened, behold the Lord shall bless them and prolong
      their days, notwithstanding their iniquity; yea, even if they should dwindle in unbelief, the
      Lord shall prolong their days until the time shall come which hath been spoken of by our
      fathers, and also by the prophet Zenos, and many other prophets, concerning the restoration of
      our brethren, the Lamanites again, to the knowledge of the truth; yea, I say unto you, That in
      the latter times, the promises of the Lord notwithstanding the many afflictions which they
      shall have, and notwithstanding they shall be driven to and fro upon the face of the earth,
      and be hunted, and shall be smitten and scattered abroad, having no place for refuge, the Lord
      shall be merciful unto them; and this is according to the prophecy, that they shall again be
      brought to the true knowledge, which is the knowledge of their Redeemer, and their great and
      their true Shepherd, and be numbered among his sheep. Therefore I say unto you, It shall be
      better for them than for you, except ye repent. For behold, had the mighty works been shewn
      unto them which have been shewn unto you; yea, unto them which have dwindled in unbelief
      because of the traditions of their fathers, ye can see of yourselves, that they never would
      again have dwindled in unbelief; therefore, saith the Lord, I will not utterly destroy them,
      but I will cause that in the day of my wisdom, they shall return again unto me, saith the
      Lord. And now behold, saith the Lord, concerning the people of the Nephites, if they will not
      repent, and observe to do my will, I will utterly destroy them, saith the Lord, because of
      their unbelief, notwithstanding the many mighty works which I have done among them; and as
      surely as the Lord liveth, shall these things be, saith the Lord. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that there were many which heard the words of Samuel, the
      Lamanite, which he spake upon the walls of the city. And as many as believed on his words,
      went forth and sought for Nephi; and when they had came forth and found him, they confessed
      unto him their sins and denied not, desiring that they might be baptized unto the Lord. But as
      many as there were which did not believe in the words of Samuel, were angry with him; and they
      cast stones at him upon the wall, and also many shot arrows at him, as he stood upon the wall;
      but the spirit of the Lord was with him, insomuch that they could not hit him with their
      stones, neither with their arrows. Now when they saw this, that they could not hit him, there
      were many more which did believe on his words, insomuch that they went away unto Nephi to be
      baptized. For behold, Nephi was baptizing, and prophesying and preaching, crying repentance
      unto the people; shewing signs and wonders; working miracles among the people, that they might
      know that the Christ must shortly come; telling them of things which must shortly come, that
      they might know and remember at the time of their coming, that they had been made known unto
      them beforehand, to the intent that they might believe; therefore as many as believed on the
      words of Samuel, went forth unto him to be baptized, for they came repenting and confessing
      their sins. But the more part of them did not believe in the words of Samuel; therefore when
      they saw that they could not hit him with their stones and their arrows, they cried unto their
      captains, saying, Take this fellow and bind him, for behold, he hath a Devil; and because of
      the power of the Devil which is in him, we cannot hit him with our stones and our arrows;
      therefore take him and bind him, and away with him. And as they went forth to lay their hands
      on him, behold, he did cast himself down from the wall, and did flee out of their lands, yea,
      even unto his own counrty, and began to preach and to prophesy among his own people. And
      behold, he was never heard of more among the Nephites; and thus were the affairs of the
      people. And thus ended the eighty and sixth year of the reign of the Judges over the people of
      Nephi. And thus ended also, the eighty and seventh year of the reign of the Judges, the more
      part of the people remaining in their pride and wickedness, and the lesser part walking more
      circumspectly before God. And these were the conditions also, in the eighty and eighth year of
      the reign of the Judges. And there were but little alteration in the affairs of the people,
      save it were the people began to be more hardened in iniquity, and do more and more of that
      which was contrary to the commandments of God, in the eighty and ninth year of the reign of
      the Judges. But it came to pass in the ninetieth year of the reign of the Judges, there were
      great signs given unto the people, and wonders; and the words of the prophets began to be
      fulfilled; and angels did appear unto men, wise men, and did declare unto them glad tidings of
      great joy; thus in this year the Scriptures began to be fulfilled. Nevertheless, the people
      began to harden their hearts, all save it were the most believing part of them, both of the
      Nephites, and also the Lamanites, and began to depend upon their own strength, and upon their
      own wisdom, saying: Some things they may have guessed right, among so many; but behold, we
      know that all these great and marvellous works cannot come to pass, of which hath been spoken.
      And they began to reason and contend among themselves, saying, That is not reasonable that
      such a being as a Christ shall come; if so, and he be the Son of God, the Father of Heaven and
      of earth, as it hath been spoken, why will he not shew himself unto us, as well as unto they
      which shall be at Jerusalem? Yea, why will he not shew himself in this land, as well as in the
      land of Jerusalem? But behold, we know that this is a wicked tradition, which has been handed
      down unto us by our fathers, to cause us that we should believe in some great and marvellous
      thing which should come to pass, but not among us, but in a land which is far distant, a land
      which we know not; therefore they can keep is in ignorance, for we cannot witness with our own
      eyes that they are true. And they will by the cunning and the mysterious arts of the evil one,
      work some great mystery, which we cannot understand, which will keep us down to be servants to
      their words, and also servants unto them, for we depend upon them for to teach us the word;
      and thus will they keep us in ignorance, if we will yield ourselves unto them all the days of
      our lives. And many more did the people imagine up in their hearts, which were foolish and
      vain; and they were much disturbed, for Satan did stir them up to do iniquity continually;
      yea, he did go about, spreading rumors and contentions upon all the face of the land, that he
      might harden the hearts of the people against that which is good, and against that which
      should come; and notwithstanding the signs and the wonders which was wrought among the people
      of the Lord, and the many miracles which they did, Satan did get great hold upon the hearts of
      the people, upon all the face of the land. And thus ended the ninetieth year of the reign of
      the Judges over the people of Nephi. And thus ended the book of Helaman, according to the
      record of Helaman and his sons. </text>

    <text> Now it came to pass that the ninety and first year had passed away; and it was six
      hundred years from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem; and it was in that year that Lachoneus
      was the Chief Judge and the governor over the land. And Nephi, the son of Helaman, had
      departed out of the land of Zarahemla, giving charge unto his son Nephi, which was his eldest
      son, concerning the plates of brass, and all the records which had been kept, and all those
      things which had been kept sacred, from the departure of Lehi out of Jerusalem: then he
      departed out of the land, and whither he went, no man knoweth; and his son Nephi did keep the
      records in his stead, yea, the record of this people. And it came to pass that in the
      commencement of the ninety and second year, behold the prophecies of the prophets began to be
      fulfilled more fully; for there began to be greater signs and greater miracles wrought among
      the people. But there were some which began to say, That the time was past for the words to be
      fulfilled, which was spoken by Samuel, the Lamanite. And they began to rejoice over their
      brethren, saying, the time is past, and the words of Samuel are not fulfilled; therefore your
      joy and your faith concerning this thing, hath been vain. And it came to pass that they did
      make a great uproar throughout the land; and the people which believed, began to be very
      sorrowful, lest by any means those things which had been spoken, might not come to pass. But
      behold, they did watch steadfastly for that day, and that night, and that day, which shall be
      as one day, as if there were no night, that they might know that their faith had not been
      vain. Now it came to pass that there was a day set apart by the unbelievers, that all those
      who believed in those traditions, should be put to death, except the sign should come to pass,
      which had been given by Samuel the prophet. Now it came to pass that when Nephi, the son of
      Nephi, saw the wickedness of his people, his heart was exceeding sorrowful. And it came to
      pass that he went out and bowed himself down upon the earth, and cried mightly to his God, in
      behalf of his people; yea, those which were about to be destroyed because of their faith in
      the traditions of their fathers. And it came to pass that he cried mightly unto the Lord, all
      the day; and behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying: Lift up your head and be of
      good cheer: for behold, the time is at hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on
      the morrow come I into the world, to shew unto the world that I will fulfil all that I have
      caused to be spoken by the mouth of my Holy Prophets. Behold, I come unto my own, to fulfil
      all things which I have made known unto the children of men, from the foundation of the world,
      and to do the will, both of the Father, and the Son of the Father, because of me, and of the
      Son, because of my flesh. And behold, the time is at hand, and this night shall the sign be
      given. And it came to pass that the words which came unto Nephi, was fulfilled, according as
      they had been spoken: for behold, at the going down of the sun, there was no darkness; and the
      people began to be astonished, because there was no darkness when the night came. And there
      were many which had not believed the words of the prophets, fell to the earth, and became as
      if they were dead, for they knew that the great plan of destruction which they had laid for
      those who believed in the word of the prophets, had been frustrated; for the sign which had
      been given was already at hand; and they began to know that the Son of God must shortly
      appear; yea, in fine, all the people upon the face of the whole earth, from the west to the
      east, both in the land north and in the land south, were so exceedingly astonished, that they
      fell to the earth; for they knew that the prophets had testified of these things for many
      years, and that the sign which had been given, was already at hand; and they began to fear
      because of their iniquity and their unbelief. And it came to pass that there was no darkness
      in all that night, but it was as light as though it was mid-day. And it came to pass that the
      sun did rise in the morning again, according to its proper order; and they knew that it was
      the day that the Lord should be born, because of the signs which had been given. And it had
      come to pass, yea, all things, every whit, according to the words of the prophets. And it came
      to pass also, that a new star did appear, according to the word. And it came to pass that from
      this time forth, there began to be lyings sent forth among the people, by Satan, to harden
      their hearts, to the intent that they might not believe in those signs and wonders which they
      had seen; but notwithstanding these lyings and deceivings, the more part of the people did
      believe, and were converted unto the Lord. --And it came to pass that Nephi went forth among
      the people, and also many others, baptizing unto repentance, in the which, there were a great
      remission of sins. And thus the people began to have peace in the land; and there were no
      contentions, save it were a few that began to preach, endeavoring to prove by the Scriptures,
      that it was no more expedient to observe the law of Moses. Now in this thing they did err,
      having not understood the Scriptures. But it came to pass that they soon became converted, and
      were convinced of the error which they were in: for it was made known unto them that the law
      was not yet fulfilled, and that it must be fulfilled in every whit; yea, the word came unto
      them that it must be fulfilled; yea, that one jot nor title should not pass away, till it
      should all be fulfilled; therefore in this same year, were they brought to a knowledge of
      their error, and did confess their faults. And thus the ninety and second year did pass away,
      bringing glad tidings unto the people because of the signs which had come to pass, according
      to the words of the prophecy of all the Holy Prophets. And it came to pass that the ninety and
      third year did also pass away in peace, save it were for the Gadianton robbers, which dwelt in
      the mountains, which did infest the land; for so strong were their holds and their secret
      places, that the people could not overpower them; therefore they did commit many murders, and
      did do much slaughter among the people. And it came to pass that in the ninety and fourth
      year, they began to increase in a great degree, because there were many dissenters of the
      Nephites which did flee unto them, which did cause much sorrow unto those Nephites which did
      remain in the land; and there was also a cause of much sorrow among the Lamanites; for behold,
      they had many children which did grow up and began to wax strong in years, that they became
      for themselves, and were led away by some which were Zoramites, by their lyings and their
      flattering words, to join those Gadianton robbers; and thus were the Lamanites afflicted also,
      and began to decrease as to their faith and righteousness, because of the wickedness of the
      rising generation. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that thus passed away the ninety and fifth year also, and the people
      began to forget those signs and wonders which they had heard, and began to be less and less
      astonished at a sign or a wonder from Heaven, insomuch that they began to be hard in their
      hearts, and blind in their minds, and began to disbelieve all which they had heard and seen,
      imagining up some vain thing in their hearts, that it was wrought by men, and by the power of
      the Devil, to lead away and deceive the hearts of the people; and thus did Satan get
      possession of the hearts of the people again, insomuch that he did blind their eyes, and lead
      them away to believe that the doctrine of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing. And it came
      to pass that the people began to wax strong in wickedness and abominations; and they did not
      believe that there should be any more signs or wonders given; and Satan did go about, leading
      away the hearts of the people. tempting them and causing them that they should do great
      wickedness in the land. And thus did pass away the ninety and sixth year; and also the ninety
      and seventh year; and also the ninety and eighth year; and also the ninety and ninth year; and
      also an hundred years had passed away, since the days of Mosiah, which was the king over the
      people of the Nephites. And six hundred and nine years had passed away, since Lehi left
      Jerusalem; and nine years had passed away, from the time which the sign was given, which was
      spoken of by the prophets, that Christ should come into the world. Now the Nephites began to
      reckon their time from this period which was the sign given, or from the coming of Christ;
      therefore, nine years had passed away, and Nephi, which was the father of Nephi, which had the
      charge of the records, did not return to the land of Zarahemla, and could no where be found in
      all the land. And it came to pass that the people did still remain in wickedness,
      notwithstanding the much preaching and prophesying which was sent among them; and thus passed
      away the tenth year also; and the eleventh year also passed away in iniquity. And it came to
      pass in the thirteenth year, there began to be wars and contentions throughout all the land:
      for the Gadianton robbers had become so numerous, and did slay so many of the people, and did
      lay waste so many cities, and did spread so much death and carnage throughout the land, that
      it became expedient that all the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, should take up
      arms against them; therefore all the Lamanites which had become converted unto the Lord, did
      unite with their brethren, the Nephites, and were compelled, for the safety of their lives,
      and their women and their children, to take up arms against those Gadianton robbers; yea, and
      also maintain their rights, and their privileges of their church, and of their worship, and
      their freedom, and their liberty. And it came to pass that before the thirteenth year had
      passed away, the Nephites were threatened with utter destruction, because of this war, which
      had become exceeding sore. And it came to pass that those Lamanites which had united with the
      Nephites, were numbered among the Nephites; and their curse was taken from them, and their
      skin became white like unto the Nephites; and their young men and their daughters became
      exceeding fair, and they were numbered among the Nephites, and were called Nephites. And thus
      ended the thirteenth year. And it came to pass in the commencement of the fourteenth year, the
      war between the robbers and the people of Nephi did continue, and did become exceeding sore;
      nevertheless, the people of Nephi did gain some advantage of the robbers, insomuch that they
      did drive them back out of their lands into the mountains, and into their secret places. And
      thus ended the fourteenth year. And in the fifteenth year they did come forth against the
      people of Nephi; and because of the wickedness of the people of Nephi, and their many
      contentions and dissentions, the Gadianton robbers did gain many advantages over them. And
      thus ended the fifteenth year; and thus were the people in a state of many afflictions; and
      the sword of destruction did hang over them, insomuch that they were about to be smitten down
      by it, and this because of their iniquity. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that in the sixteenth year from the coming of Christ, Lachoneus,
      the Governor of the land, received an epistle from the leaders and the Governor of this band
      of robbers; and these were the words which were written, saying: Lachoneus, most noble and
      Chief Governor of the land: behold I write this epistle unto you, and do give unto you
      exceeding great praise because of your firmness, and also the firmness of your people, in
      maintaining that which ye suppose to be your right and liberty; yea, ye do stand well, as if
      ye were supported by the hand of God, in the defence of your liberty, and your property, and
      your country, or that which ye do call so. And it seemeth a pity unto me, most noble
      Lachoneus, that ye should be so foolish and vain as to suppose that ye can stand against so
      many brave men, which are at my command, which do now at this time stand in their arms, and do
      await, with great anxiety, for the word, Go down upon the Nephites and destroy them. And I
      knowing of their unconquerable spirit, having proved them in the field of battle, and knowing
      of their everlasting hatred towards you, because of the many wrongs which ye have done unto
      them, therefore if they should come down against you, they would visit you with utter
      destruction; therefore I have wrote this epistle, sealing it with mine own hand, feeling for
      your welfare, because of your firmness in that which ye believe to be right, and your noble
      spirit in the field of battle; therefore I write unto you desiring that ye would yield up unto
      this my people, your cities, your lands, and your possessions, rather than that they should
      visit you with the sword, and that destruction should come upon you; or in other words, yield
      yourselves up unto us, and unite with us, and become acquainted with our secret works, and
      become our brethren, that ye may be like unto us; not our slaves, but our brethren, and
      partners of all our substance. And behold, I swear unto you, if ye will do this, with an oath,
      ye shall not be destroyed; but if ye will not do this, I swear unto you, with an oath, that on
      the morrow month, I will command that my armies shall come down against you, and they shall
      not stay their hand, and shall spare not, but shall slay you, and shall let fall the sword
      upon you, even until ye shall become extinct. And behold, I am Giddianhi, and I am the
      Governor of this secret society of Gadianton; which society, and the works thereof, I know to
      be good; and they are of ancient date, and they have been handed down unto us. And I write
      this epistle unto you, Lachoneus, and I hope that ye will deliver up your lands, and your
      possessions, without the shedding of blood, that this my people may recover their rights and
      government which have dissented away from you, because of your wickedness in retaining from
      them their rights of government; and except ye do this, I will avenge their wrongs. I am
      Giddianhi. And now it came to pass when Lachoneus received this epistle, he was exceedingly
      astonished, because of the boldness of Giddianhi, demanding the possession of the land of the
      Nephites, and also of threatening the people, and avenging the wrongs of those that had
      received no wrong, save it were they had wronged themselves, by dissenting away unto those
      wicked and abominable robbers. Now behold, this Lachoneus, the Governor, was a plain man, and
      could not be frightened by the demands and the threatenings of a robber; therefore he did not
      hearken to the epistle of Giddianhi, the Governor of the robbers, but he did cause that his
      people should cry unto the Lord for strength against the time that the robbers should come
      down against them; yea, he sent a proclamation among all the people, that they should gather
      together their women, and their children, their flocks and their herds, and all their
      substance, save it were their land, unto one place. And he caused that fortifications should
      be built round about them, and the strength thereof should be exceeding great. And he caused
      that there should be armies, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites, or of all of them
      which were numbered among the Nephites, should be placed as guards round about, to watch them,
      and to guard them from the robbers, day and night; yea, he said unto them, As the Lord liveth,
      except ye repent of all your iniquities, and cry unto the Lord, that they would in no wise be
      delivered out of the hands of those Gadianton robbers. And so great and marvellous were the
      words and prophecies of Lachoneus, that they did cause fear to come upon all the people, and
      they did exert themselves in their might, to do according to the words of Lachoneus. And it
      came to pass that Lachoneus did appoint Chief Captains over all the armies of the Nephites, to
      command them at the time that the robbers should come down out of the wilderness against them.
      Now the chiefest among all the Captains, and the great Commander of all the armies of the
      Nephites, was appointed, and his name was Gidgiddoni. Now it was the custom of all the
      Nephites, to appoint for their Chief Captains, save it were in their times of wickedness,
      someone that had the spirit of revelation, and also of prophecy; therefore this Gidgiddoni was
      a great prophet among them, and also was the Chief Judge. Now the people said unto Gidgiddoni,
      Pray unto the Lord, and let us go up upon the mountains, and into the wilderness, that we may
      fall upon the robbers and destroy them, in their own lands. But Gidgiddoni saith unto them,
      the Lord forbid; for if we should go up against them, the Lord would deliver us into their
      hands; therefore we will prepare ourselves in the centre of our lands, and we will gather all
      out armies together, and we will not go against them, but we will wait till they shall come
      against us; therefore, as the Lord liveth, if we do this, he will deliver them into our hands.
      And it came to pass in the seventeenth year in the latter end of the year, the proclamation of
      Lachoneus had gone forth throughout all the face of the land, and they had taken their horses
      and their chariots, and their cattle, and all their flocks, and their herds, and their grain,
      and all their substance, and did march forth by thousands, and by the tens of thousands, until
      they had all gone forth to the place which had been appointed, that they should gather
      themselves together, to defend themselves against their enemies. And the land which was
      appointed was the land of Zarahemla, and the land which was between the land of Zarahemla and
      the land Bountiful; yea, to the line which was between the land Bountiful and the land
      Desolation; and there were a great many thousand people, which were called Nephites, which did
      gather themselves together in this land. Now Lachoneus did cause that they should gather
      themselves together in the land southward, because of the great curse which was upon the land
      northward; and they did fortify themselves against their enemies, and they did dwell in one
      land, and in one body, and they did fear the words which had been spoken by Lachoneus,
      insomuch that they did repent of all their sins; and they did put up their prayers unto the
      Lord their God, that he would deliver them in the time that their enemies should come down
      against them to battle. And they were exceeding sorrowful because of their enemy. And
      Gidgiddoni did cause that they should make weapons of war, of every kind, that they should be
      strong with armor, and with shields, and with bucklers, after the manner of his instruction.

    <text> And it came to pass that in the latter end of the eighteenth year, those armies of
      robbers had prepared for battle, and began to come down, and to sally forth from the hills,
      and out of the mountains, and the wilderness, and their strong holds, and their secret places,
      and began to take possession of the lands, both which was in the land south, and which was in
      the land north, and began to take possession of all the lands which had been deserted by the
      Nephites, and the cities which had been left desolate. But behold there was no wild beasts nor
      game in those lands which had been deserted by the Nephites, and there was no game for the
      robbers save it were in the wilderness. And the robbers could not exist save it were in the
      wilderness, for the want of food; for the Nephites had left their lands desolate, and had
      gathered their flocks, and their herds, and all their substance, and they were in one body;
      therefore there were no chance for the robbers to plunder and to obtain food, save it were to
      come up in open battle against the Nephites; and the Nephites being in one body, and having so
      great a number, and having reserved for themselves provisions, and horses, and cattle, and
      flocks of every kind, that they might subsist for the space of seven years, in the which time
      they did hope to destroy the robbers from off the face of the land. And thus the eighteenth
      year did pass away. And it came to pass that in the nineteenth year, Giddianhi found that it
      was expedient that he should go up to battle against the Nephites, for there was no way that
      they could subsist, save it were to plunder, and rob, and murder. And they durst not spread
      themselves upon the face of the land, insomuch that they could raise grain, lest the Nephites
      should come upon them and slay them; therefore Giddianhi gave commandment unto his armies,
      that in this year they should go up to battle against the Nephites. And it came to pass that
      they did come up to battle; and it was in the sixth month; and behold, great and terrible was
      the day that they did come up to battle; and they were girded about after the manner of
      robbers; and they had a lamb-skin about their loins, and they were dyed in blood; and their
      heads were shorn; and they had head-plates upon them; and great and terrible was the
      appearance of the armies of Giddianhi, because of their armor, and because of their being dyed
      in blood. And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites, when they saw the appearance of
      the army of Giddianhi, had all fallen to the earth, and did lift their cries to the Lord their
      God, that he would spare them, and deliver them out of the hands of their enemies. And it came
      to pass that when the armies of Gaddianhi saw this, they began to shout with a loud voice,
      because of their joy; for they had supposed that the Nephites had fallen with fear, because of
      the terror of their armies; but in this thing they were disappointed, for the Nephites did not
      fear them, but they did fear their God, and did supplicate him for protection; therefore when
      the armies of Giddianhi did rush upon them, they were prepared to meet them; yea, in the
      strength of the Lord they did receive them; and the battle commenced in this the sixth month;
      and great and terrible was the slaughter thereof, insomuch that there never was known so great
      a slaughter among all the people of Lehi since he left Jerusalem. And notwithstanding the
      threatenings and the oaths which Giddianhi had made, behold, the Nephites did beat them,
      insomuch that they did fall back from before them. And it came to pass that Gidgiddoni
      commanded that his armies should pursue them as far as to the borders of the wilderness, and
      that they should not spare any that should fall into their hands by the way; and thus they did
      pursue them, and did slay them, to the borders of the wilderness, even until they had
      fulfilled the commandment of Gidgiddoni. And it came to pass that Giddianhi, who had stood and
      fought with boldness, was pursued as he fled; and being weary because of his much fighting, he
      was overtaken and slain. And thus was the end of Giddianhi, the robber. And it came to pass
      that the armies of the Nephites did return again to their place of security. And it came to
      pass that this nineteenth year did pass away, and the robbers did not come again to battle;
      neither did they come again in the twentieth year; and in the twenty first year they did not
      come up to battle, but they came up on all sides to lay siege round about the people of Nephi;
      for they did suppose that if they should cut off the people of Nephi from their lands, and
      should hem them in on every side, and if they should cut them off from all their outward
      privileges, that they would cause them to yield themselves up according to their wishes. Now
      they had appointed unto themselves another leader, whose name was Zemnarihah; therefore it was
      Zemnarihah; that did cause that this siege should take place. But behold this was an advantage
      unto the Nephites; for it was impossible for the robbers to lay siege sufficiently long to
      have an effect upon the Nephites, because of their much provision which they had laid up in
      store because of the scantiness of provisions among the robbers; for behold they had nothing
      save it were meat for their substance, which meat they did obtain in the wilderness. And it
      came to pass that the wild game became scarce in the wilderness, insomuch that the robbers
      were about to perish with hunger. And the Nephites were continually marching out by day and by
      night, and falling upon their armies, and cutting them off by thousands and by ten thousands.
      And thus it became the desire of the people of Zemnarihah, to withdraw from their design,
      because of the great destruction which come upon them by night and by day. And it came to pass
      that Zemnarihah did give command unto his people, that they should withdraw themselves from
      the siege, and march into the farthermost parts of the land, northward. And now Gidgiddoni,
      being aware of their design, and knowing their weakness because of the want of food, and the
      great slaughter which had been made among them, therefore he did send out his armies in the
      night- time, and did cut off the way of their retreat, and did place his armies in the way of
      their retreat; and this did they do in the night-time, and got on their march beyond the
      robbers, so that on the morrow, when the robbers began their march, they were met by the
      armies of the Nephites, both in their front and in their rear. And the robbers which were on
      the south, were also cut off in their place of retreat. And all these things were done by
      command of Gidgiddoni. And there were many thousands which did yield themselves up prisoners
      unto the Nephites; and the remainder of them were slain; and their leader Zemnarihah was
      taken, and hanged upon a tree, yea, even upon the top thereof until he was dead. And when they
      had hanged him until he was dead, they did fall the tree to the earth, and did cry with a loud
      voice, saying, May the Lord preserve his people in righteousness and in holiness of heart,
      that they may cause to be fell to the earth all who shall seek to slay them because of power
      and secret combinations, even as this man hath been fell to the earth. And they did rejoice
      and cry again with one voice, saying, May the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the
      God of Jacob, protect this people in righteousness, so long as they shall call on the name of
      their God for protection. And it came to pass that they did break forth, all as one, in
      singing and praising their God, for the great thing which he had done for them, in preserving
      them from falling into the hands of their enemies; yea, they did cry, Hosanna to the Most High
      God; and they did cry, Blessed be the name of the Lord God Almighty, the Most High God. And
      their hearts were swollen with joy, unto the gushing out of many tears, because of the great
      goodness of God in delivering them out of the hands of their enemies; and they knew it was
      because of their repentance and their humility that they had been delivered from an
      everlasting destruction. </text>

    <text> And now behold there was not a living soul among all the people of the Nephites, which
      did doubt in the least thing in the words of all the holy prophets which had spoken; for they
      knew that it must needs be that they must be fulfilled; and they knew that it must be
      expedient that Christ had come, because of the many signs which had been given, according to
      the words of the prophets; and because of the things which had come to pass already, they knew
      it must needs be that all things should come to pass according to that which had been spoken;
      therefore they did forsake all their sins, and their abominations, and their whoredoms, and
      did serve God with all diligence, day and night. And now it came to pass that when they had
      taken all the robbers prisoners, insomuch that none did escape which were not slain, they did
      cast their prisoners into prison, and did cause the word of God to be preached unto them; and
      as many as would repent of their sins and enter into a covenant that they would murder no
      more, were set at liberty; but as many as there were who did not enter into a covenant, and
      who did still continue to have those secret murders in their hearts; yea, as many as were
      found breathing out threatenings against their brethren, were condemned and punished according
      to the law. And thus they did put an end to all those wicked, and secret, and abominable
      combinations, in the which there were so much wickedness, and so many murders committed. And
      thus had the twenty and second year passed away, and the twenty and third year also, and the
      twenty and fourth, and the twenty and fifth; and thus had twenty and five years passed away,
      and there had been many things transpired which, in the eyes of some, would be great and
      marvellous; nevertheless, they cannot all be written in this book; yea, this book cannot
      contain even a hundredth part of what was done among so many people in the space of twenty and
      five years; but behold there are records which do contain all the proceedings of this people;
      and a more short but a true account was given by Nephi; therefore I have made my record of
      these things according to the record of Nephi, which were engraven on the plates which were
      called the plates of Nephi. And behold I do make the record on plates which I have made with
      mine own hands. And behold, I am called Mormon, being called after the land of Mormon, the
      land in which Alma did establish the church among the people; yea, the first church which was
      established among them after their transgression. Behold I am a disciple of Jesus Christ, the
      Son of God. I have been called of him to declare his word among his people, that they might
      have everlasting life. And it hath become expedient that I according to the will of God, that
      the prayers of those which have gone hence, which were the holy ones, should be fulfilled
      according to their faith, should make a record of these things which have been done; yea, a
      small record of that which hath taken place from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem, even down
      until the present time; therefore I do make my record from the accounts which hath been given
      by those which were before me, until the commencement of my day; and then I do make a record
      of the things which I have seen with mine own eyes. And I know the record which I make to be a
      just and true record; neverthelers there are many things which according to our language, we
      are not able to write. And now I make an end of my sayings which is of myself, and proceed to
      give my account of the things which hath been before me. I am Mormon, and a pure descendant of
      Lehi. I have reason to bless my God and my saviour Jesus Christ, that he brought our fathers
      out of the land of Jerusalem, (and no one knew it save it were himself and those which he
      brought out of that land,) and that he hath given me and my people so much knowledge unto the
      salvation of our souls. Surely he hath blessed the house of Jacob, and hath been merciful unto
      the seed of Joseph. An insomuch as the children of Lehi hath kept his commandments, he hath
      blessed them and prospered them according to his word; yea, and surely shall he again bring a
      remnant of the seed of Joseph to the knowledge of the Lord their God; and as surely as the
      Lord liveth will he gather in from the four quarters of the earth, all the remnant of the seed
      of Jacob, which was scattered abroad upon all the face of the earth; and as he hath covenanted
      with all the house Jacob, even so shall the covenant wherewith he hath covenanted with the
      house of Jacob, be fulfilled in his own due time, unto the restoring all the house of Jacob
      unto the knowledge of the covenant that he hath covenanted with them; and then shall they know
      their Redeemer, which is Jesus Christ, the Son of God; and then shall they be gathered in from
      the four quarters of the earth, unto their lands, from whence they have been dispersed; yea,
      as the Lord liveth, so shall it be. Amen. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that the people of the Nephites did all return to their own
      lands, in the twenty and sixth year, every man, with his family, his flocks and his herds, his
      horses and his cattle, and all things whatsoever did belong unto them. And it came to pass
      that they had not eaten up all their provisions; therefore they did take with them all that
      they had not devoured, of all their grain of every kind, and their gold, and their silver, and
      all their precious things, and they did return to their own lands and their possessions, both
      on the north, and on the south, both in the lands northward and on the land southward. And
      they granted unto those robbers which had entered into a covenant to keep the peace, of the
      band which were desirous to remain Lamanites, lands, according to their numbers, that they
      might have with their labors, wherewith to subsist upon; and thus they did establish peace in
      all the land. And they began again to prosper and to wax great; and the twenty and sixth and
      seventh years passed away, and there was great order in the land; and they had formed their
      laws according to equity and justice. And now there was nothing in all the land, to hinder the
      people from prospering continually, except they should fall into transgression. And now it was
      Gidgiddoni, and the Judge Lachoneus, and those which had been appointed leaders, which had
      established this great peace in the land. And it came to pass that there were many cities
      built anew, and there were many old cities repaired; and there were many highways cast up, and
      many roads made, which led from city to city, and from land to land, and from place to place.
      And thus passed away the twenty and eighth year, and the people had continual peace. But it
      came to pass in the twenty and ninth year, there began to be some disputings among the people;
      and some were lifted up in pride and boastings, because of their exceeding great riches, yea,
      even unto great persecutions: for there were many merchants in the land, and also many
      lawyers, and many officers. And the people began to be distinguished by ranks, according to
      their riches, and their chances for learning; yea, some were ignorant because of their
      poverty, and others did receive great learning because of their riches; some were lifted up in
      pride, and others were exceeding humble; some did return railing for railing, while others
      would receive railing, and persecution, and all manner of afflictions, and would not turn and
      revile again, but were humble and penitent before God; and thus there became a great
      inequality in all the land, insomuch that the church began to be broken up; yea, insomuch that
      in the thirtieth year the church was broken up in all the land, save it were among a few of
      the Lamanites, which were converted unto the true faith; and they would not depart from it,
      for they were firm, and steadfast, and immoveable, willing with all diligence to keep the
      commandments of the Lord. Now the cause of this iniquity of the people was this: Satan had
      great power unto the stirring up of the people to do all manner of iniquity, and to the
      puffing them up with pride, tempting them to seek for power, and authority, and riches, and
      the vain things of the world. And thus Satan did lead away the hearts of the people, to do all
      manner of iniquity; therefore they had not enjoyed peace but a few years. And thus in the
      commencement of the thirtieth year, the people having been delivered up for the space of a
      long time, to be carried about by the temptations of the Devil whithersoever he desired to
      carry them, and to do whatsoever iniquity he desired they should; and thus in the commencement
      of this, the thirtieth year, they were in a state of awful wickedness. Now they did not sin
      ignorantly, for they knew the will of God concerning them, for it had been taught unto them;
      therefore they did wilfully rebel against God. And now it was in the days of Lachoneus, the
      son of Lachoneus: for Lachoneus did fill the seat of his father, and did govern the people
      that year. And there began to be men inspired from heaven, and sent forth, standing among the
      people in all the land, preaching and testifying boldly of the sins and iniquities of the
      people, and testifying unto them concerning the redemption which the Lord would make for his
      people; or in other words, the resurrection of Christ; and they did testify boldly of his
      death and sufferings. Now there were many of the people which were exceeding angry, because of
      those which testified of these things; and those which were angry, were chiefly the Chief
      Judges, and they which had been High Priests, and lawyers; yea, all they which were lawyers,
      were angry with those which testified of these things. Now there was no lawyer, nor Judge, nor
      High Priest, that could have power to condemn any one to death, save their condemnation was
      signed by the governor of the land. Now there were many of those which testified of the things
      pertaining to Christ, which testified boldly, which were taken and put to death secretly, by
      the Judges, that the knowledge of their death came not unto the governor of the land, until
      after their death. Now behold, this was contrary to the laws of the land, that any man should
      be put to death, except they had power from the governor of the land; therefore a complaint
      came up unto the land of Zarahemla, to the governor of the land, against these Judges which
      had condemned the prophets of the land unto death, not according to the law. Now it came to
      pass that they were taken and brought up before the Judge, to be judged of the crime which
      they had done, according to the law which had been given by the people. Now it came to pass
      that those Judges had many friends and kindreds; and the remainder, yea, even almost all the
      lawyers and the High Priests, did gather themselves together, and unite with the kindreds of
      those Judges which were to be tried according to the law; and they did enter into a covenant
      one with another, yea, even into that covenant which was given by them of old, which covenant
      was given and administered by the Devil, to combine against all righteousness; therefore they
      did combine against the people of the Lord, and enter into a covenant to destroy them, and to
      deliver those which were guilty of murder from the grasp of justice, which was about to be
      administered according to the law. And they did set at defiance the law and the rights of
      their country; and they did covenant, one with another, to destroy the governor, and to
      establish a king over the land, that the land should no more be at liberty, but should be
      subject unto kings. </text>

    <text> Now behold, I will shew unto you that they did not establish a king over the land; but in
      the same year, yea, the thirtieth year, they did destroy upon the judgment seat, yea, did
      murder the Chief Judge of the land. And the people were divided one against another; and they
      did separate one from another, into tribes, every man according to his family, and his kindred
      and friends; and thus they did destroy the government of the land. And every tribe did appoint
      a Chief, or a leader over them; and thus they became tribes, and leaders of tribes. Now
      behold, there was no man among them, save he had much family and many kindreds and friends;
      therefore their tribes became exceeding great. Now all this was done, and there was no wars as
      yet among them; and all this iniquity had come upon the people, because they did yield
      themselves unto the power of Satan; and the regulations of the government was destroyed,
      because of the secret combinations of the friends and kindreds of them which murdered the
      prophets. And they did cause great contention in the land, insomuch that the more righteous
      part of the people, although they were nearly all become wicked; yea, there were but few
      righteous men among them. And thus six years had not passed away, since the more part of the
      people had turned from their righteousness, like the dog to his vomit, or like the sow to her
      wallowing in the mire. --Now this great combination which had brought so great iniquity upon
      the people, did gather themselves together, and did place at their head a man whom they did
      call Jacob; and they did call him their king; therefore he became a king over this wicked
      band; and he was one of the chiefest which had given his voice against the prophets which
      testified of Jesus. --And it came to pass that they were not so strong in number as the tribes
      of the people which were united together, save it were their leaders did establish their laws,
      every one according to his tribe; nevertheless they were enemies, notwithstanding they were
      not a righteous people; yet they were united in the hatred of those who had entered into a
      covenant to destroy the government; therefore Jacob seeing that their enemies were more
      numerous than they, he being the king of the band, therefore he commanded his people that they
      should take their flight into the northernmost part of the land, and there build up unto
      themselves a kingdom, until they were joined by dissenters, (for he flattered them that there
      would be many dissenters,) and they become sufficiently strong to contend with the tribes of
      the people. And they did so; and so speedy was their march, that it could not be impeded,
      until they had gone forth out of the reach of the people. And thus ended the thirtieth year;
      and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi. And it came to pass in the thirty and first
      year, that they were divided into tribes, every man according to his family, kindred and
      friends; nevertheless they had come to an agreement that they would not go to war one with
      another; but they were not united as to their laws, and their manner of government, for they
      were established according to the minds of them which was their chiefs and their leaders. But
      they did establish very strict laws that one tribe should not trespass against another,
      insomuch that in some degree they had peace in the land; nevertheless, their hearts were
      turned from the Lord their God, and they did stone the prophets, and did cast them out from
      among them. And it came to pass that Nephi, having been visited by angels, and also by the
      voice of the Lord, therefore having seen angels, and being an eyewitness, and having had power
      given unto him that he might know concerning the ministry of Christ, and also being eyewitness
      to their quick return from righteousness unto their wickedness and abominations; therefore,
      being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, and the blindness of their minds, went forth
      among them in that same year, and began to testify boldly, repentance and remission of sins
      through faith on the Lord Jesus Christ. And he did minister many things unto them; and all of
      them cannot be written, and a part of them would not suffice; therefore they are not written
      in this book. And Nephi did minister with power and with great authority. And it came to pass
      that they were angry with him, even because he had greater power than they, for it were not
      possible that they could disbelieve his words; for so great was his faith on the Lord Jesus
      Christ, that angels did minister unto him daily; and in the name of Jesus did he cast out
      devils and unclean spirits; and even his brother did he raise from the dead, after he had been
      stoned and suffered death by the people; and the people saw it, and did witness of it, and
      were angry with him, because of his power; and he did also do many more miracles, in the sight
      of the people, in the name of Jesus. And it came to pass that the thirty and first year did
      pass away, and there were but few which were converted unto the Lord; but as many as were
      converted, did truly signify unto the people that they had been visited by the power and
      spirit of God, which was in Jesus Christ, in whom they believed. --And as many as had devils
      cast out from them, and were healed of their sicknesses and their infirmities, did truly
      manifest unto the people that they had been wrought upon by the spirit of God, and had been
      healed; and they did shew forth signs also, and did do some miracles among the people. And it
      came to pass that thus passed away the thirty and second year also. And Nephi did cry unto the
      people in the commencement of the thirty and third year; and he did preach unto them
      repentance and remission of sins. Now I would have you to remember also, that there were none
      which were brought unto repentance, who were not baptized with water; therefore there were
      ordained of Nephi, men unto this ministry, that all such as should come unto them, should be
      baptized with water, and this as a witness and a testimony before God, and unto the people,
      that they had repented and received a remission of their sins. And there were many in the
      commencement of this year, that were baptized unto repentance; and thus the more part of the
      year did pass away. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that according to our record, and we know our record to be true:
      for behold, it was a just man which did keep the record; for he truly did many miracles in the
      name of Jesus; and there was not any man which could do a miracle in the name of Jesus, save
      he were cleansed every whit from his iniquity. And now it came to pass, if there was no
      mistake made by this man in the reckoning of our time, the thirty and third year had passed
      away, and the people began to look with great earnestness for the sign which had been given by
      the prophet Samuel, and Lamanite; yea, for the time that there should be darkness for the
      space of three days, over the face of the land. And there began to be great doubtings and
      disputations among the people, notwithstanding so many signs had been given. And it came to
      pass in the thirty and fourth year, in the first month, in the fourth day of the month, there
      arose a great storm, such an one as never had been known in all the land; and there was also a
      great and terrible tempest; and there was terrible thunder, insomuch that it did shake the
      whole earth as if it was about to divide asunder; and there was exceeding sharp lightnings,
      such as never had been known in all the land. And the city of Zarahemla did take fire; and the
      city of Moroni did sink into the depths of the sea, and the inhabitants thereof were drowned;
      and the earth was carried up upon the city of Moronihah, that in the place of the city
      thereof, there became a great mountain; and there was a great and terrible destruction in the
      land southward. But behold, there was a more great and terrible destruction in the land
      northward: for behold, the whole face of the land changed, because of the tempest, and the
      whirlwinds, and the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the exceeding great quaking of the
      whole earth; and the highways were broken up, and the level roads were spoiled, and many
      smooth places became rough, and many great and noble cities were sunk, and many were burned,
      and many were shook till the buildings thereof had fallen to the earth, and the inhabitants
      thereof were slain, and the places were left desolate; and there were some cities which
      remained; but the damage thereof was exceeding great, and there were many in them which were
      slain; and there were some which were carried away in the whirlwind; and whither they went, no
      man knoweth, save they know that they were carried away; and thus the face of the whole earth
      became deformed, because of the tempests, and the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the
      quaking of the earth. And behold, the rocks were rent in twain; yea, they were broken up upon
      the face of the whole earth, insomuch that they were found in broken fragments, and in seams,
      and in cracks, upon all the face of the land. And it came to pass that when the thunderings,
      and the lightnings, and the storm, and the tempest, and the quakings of the earth did cease
      --for behold, they did last for about the space of three hours; and it was said by some that
      the time was greater; nevertheless, all these great and terrible things were done in about the
      space of three hours; and then behold, there was darkness upon the face of the land. And it
      came to pass that there was thick darkness upon the face of all the land, insomuch that the
      inhabitants thereof which had not fallen, could feel the vapour of darkness; and there could
      be no light, because of the darkness, neither candles, neither torches; neither could there be
      fire kindled with their fine and exceeding dry wood, so that there could not be any light at
      all; and there was not any light seen, neither fire, nor glimmer, neither the sun, nor the
      moon, nor the stars, for so great were the midst of darkness which were upon the face of the
      land. And it came to pass that it did last for the space of three days, that there was no
      light seen; and there was great mourning, and howling, and weeping among all the people
      continually; yea, great were the groanings of the people, because of the darkness and the
      great destruction which had come upon them. And in one place they were heard to cry, saying: O
      that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and then would our brethren have been
      spared, and they would not have been burned in that great city Zarahemla. And in another place
      they were heard to cry and mourn, saying: O that we had repented before this great and
      terrible day, and had not killed and stoned the prophets, and cast them out; then would our
      mothers, and our fair daughters, and our children have been spared, and not have been buried
      up in that great city Moronihah; and thus were the howlings of the people great and terrible.

    <text> And it came to pass that there was a voice heard among all the inhabitants of the earth
      upon all the face of this land, crying, Wo, wo, wo unto this people; wo unto the inhabitants
      of the whole earth, except they shall repent, for the Devil laugheth, and his angels rejoice,
      because of the slain of the fair sons and daughters of my people; and it is because of their
      iniquity and abominations that they are fallen. Behold, that great city Zarahemla have I
      burned with fire, and the inhabitants thereof. And behold, that great city Moroni have I
      caused to be sunk in the depths of the sea, and the inhabitants to be drowned. And behold,
      that great city Moronihah have I covered with earth, and the inhabitants thereof, to hide
      their iniquities and their abominations from before my face, that the blood of the prophets
      and the saints shall not come up any more unto me against them. And behold, the city of Gilgal
      have I caused to be sunk, and the inhabitants thereof to be buried up in the depths of the
      earth; yea, and the city Onihah, and the inhabitants thereof, and the city of Mocum, and the
      inhabitants thereof, and the city of Jerusalem, and the inhabitants thereof, and waters have I
      caused to come up in the stead thereof, to hide their wickedness and abominations from before
      my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints shall not come up any more unto me
      against them. And behold, the city of Gadiandi, and the city of Gadiomnah, and the city of
      Jacob, and the city of Gimgimno, all these have I caused to be sunk, and made hills and
      valleys in the places thereof, and the inhabitants thereof have I buried up in the depths of
      the earth, to hide their wickedness and abominations from before my face, that the blood of
      the prophets and the saints should not come up any more unto me against them. --And behold,
      that great city Jacobugath, which was inhabited by the people of the king of Jacob, have I
      caused to be burned with fire, because of their sins and their wickedness, which was above all
      the wickedness of the whole earth, because of their secret murders and combinations: for it
      was they that did destroy the peace of my people and the government of the land; therefore I
      did cause them to be burned, to destroy them from before my face, that the blood of the
      prophets and the saints should not come up unto me any more against them. And behold, the city
      of Laman, and the city of Josh, and the city of Gad, and the city of Kishkumen, have I caused
      to be burned with fire, and the inhabitants thereof, because of their wickedness in casting
      out the prophets, and stoning them which I did send to declare unto them concerning their
      wickedness and their abominations; and because they did cast them all out, that there were
      none righteous among them, I did send down fire and destroy them, that their wickedness and
      abominations might be hid from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints
      which I sent among them, might not cry unto me from the ground against them; and many great
      destructions have I caused to come upon this land, and upon this people, because of their
      wickedness and their abominations. O all ye that are spared, because ye were more righteous
      than they! will ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins, and be converted, that I
      may heal you? Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye will come unto me, ye shall have eternal life.
      Behold, mine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever will come, him will I
      receive; and blessed are they which cometh unto me. Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
      I created the Heavens and the earth, and all things that in them is. I was with the Father
      from the beginning. I am in the Father, and the Father in me; and in me hath the Father
      glorified his name. I came unto my own, and my own received me not. And the scriptures,
      concerning my coming are fulfilled. And as many as have received me, to them have I given to
      become the Sons of God; and even so will I to as many as shall believe on my name: for behold,
      by me redemption cometh, and in me is the law of Moses fulfilled. I am the light and the life
      of the world. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. And ye shall offer up unto me
      the shedding of blood; yea, your sacrifices and your burnt offerings shall be done away, for I
      will accept none of your sacrifices and your burnt offerings; and ye shall offer for a
      sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit. And whoso cometh unto me with a broken
      heart and a contrite spirit, him will I baptize with fire and with the Holy Ghost, even as the
      Lamanites, because of their faith in me, at the time of their conversion, were baptized with
      fire and with the Holy Ghost, and they knew it not. Behold, I have come unto the world to
      bring redemption unto the world, to save the world from sin; therefore whoso repenteth and
      cometh unto me as a little child, him will I receive; for of such is the kingdom of God.
      Behold, for such I have laid down my life, and have taken it up again; therefore repent, and
      come unto me ye ends of the earth, and be saved. </text>

    <text> And now behold it came to pass that all the people of the land did hear these sayings,
      and did witness of it. And after these sayings there was a silence in the land for the space
      of many hours; for so great was the astonishment of the people that they did cease lamenting
      and howling for the loss of their kindred which had been slain; therefore there was silence in
      all the land for the space of many hours. And it came to pass that there came a voice again
      unto the people, and all the people did hear, and did witness of it, saying: O ye people of
      these great cities which have fallen, which are the descendant of Jacob; yea, which are of the
      house of Israel; O ye people of the house of Israel, how oft have I gathered you as a hen
      gathereth her chickens under her wings, and have nourished you. And again, how oft would I
      have gathered you, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings; yea, O ye people of the
      house of Israel, which have fallen; yea, ye people of the house of Israel; ye that dwell at
      Jerusalem, as ye that have fallen; yea, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth
      her chickens, and ye would not. O ye house of Israel, whom I have spared, how oft will I
      gather you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if ye will repent and return unto
      me with full purpose of heart. But if not, O house of Israel, the places of your dwellings
      shall become desolate, until the time of the fulfilling of the covenant to your fathers. And
      now it came to pass that after the people had heard these words, behold they began to weep and
      howl again, because of the loss of their kindred and friends. And it came to pass that thus
      did the three days pass away. And it was in the morning and the darkness dispersed from off
      the face of the land, and the earth did cease to tremble, and the rocks did cease to rend, and
      the dreadful groanings did cease, and all the tumultous noises did pass away, and the earth
      did cleave together again, that it stood, and the mourning, and the weeping, and the wailing
      of the people which were spared alive, did cease; and their mourning was turned into joy, and
      their lamentations into the praise and the thanksgiving unto the Lord Jesus Christ, their
      Redeemer: And thus far were the scriptures fulfilled, which had been spoken by the prophets.
      --And it was the more righteous part of the people which were saved, and it was they which
      received the prophets, and stoned them not; and it was they which had not shed the blood of
      the saints, which were spared; and they were spared, and were not sunk and buried up in the
      earth; and they were not drowned in the depths of the sea; and they were not burned by fire,
      neither were they fallen upon and crushed to death; and they were not carried away in the
      whirlwind; neither were they overpowered by the vapor of smoke and of darkness. And now whoso
      readeth, let him understand; he that hath the scriptures, let him search them, and see and
      behold if all these deaths and destructions by fire, and by smoke, and by tempests, and by
      whirlwinds, and by the opening of the earth to receive them, and all these things is not unto
      the fulfilling of the prophecies of many of the holy prophets. Behold I say unto you yea, many
      have testified of these things at the coming of Christ, and were slain because they testified
      of these things; yea, the prophet Zenos did testify of these things, and also Zenock spake
      concerning these things, because they testified particular concerning us, which is the remnant
      of their seed. Behold our father Jacob also testified concerning a remnant of the seed of
      Joseph. And behold, are not we a remnant of the seed of Joseph? And those things which
      testifies of us, are they not written upon the plates of brass which our father Lehi brought
      out of Jerusalem? And it came to pass that in the ending of the thirty and fourth year, behold
      I will shew unto you that the people of Nephi which were spared, and also they which had been
      called Lamanites, which had been spared, did have great favors shew unto them, and great
      blessings poured out upon their heads, insomuch that soon after the ascension of Christ into
      Heaven, he did truly manifest himself unto them, shewing his body unto them, and ministering
      unto them; and an account of his ministry shall be given hereafter. Therefore this time I make
      an end of my sayings. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that there were a great multitude gathered together, of the
      people of Nephi, round about the temple which was in the land Bountiful; and they were
      marvelling and wondering one with another, and were shewing one to another the great and
      marvellous change which had taken place; and they were also conversing about this Jesus
      Christ, of which the sign had been given, concerning his death. And it came to pass that while
      they were thus conversing one with another, they heard a voice, as if it came out of Heaven;
      and they cast there eyes round about, for they understood not the voice which they heard; and
      it was not a harsh voice, neither was it a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it
      being a small voice, it did pierce them that did hear, to the centre, insomuch that there were
      no part of their frame that it did not cause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very
      soul, and did cause their hearts to burn. --And it came to pass that again they heard the
      voice, and they understood it not; and again the third time they did hear the voice, and did
      open their ears to hear it; and their eyes were towards the sound thereof; and they did look
      steadfastly towards Heaven, from whence the sound came; and behold, the third time they did
      understand the voice which they heard; and it saith unto them, Behold, my beloved Son, in whom
      I am well pleased, in whom I have glorified my name, hear ye him. And it came to pass as they
      understood, they cast their eyes up again towards Heaven, and behold, they saw a man
      descending out of Heaven: and he was clothed in a white robe, and he came down and stood in
      the midst of them, and the eyes of the whole multitude was turned upon him, and they durst not
      open their mouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant: for they thought it was an
      angel that had appeared unto them. And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand, and
      spake unto the people, saying: Behold I am Jesus Christ, of which the prophets testified that
      should come into the world; and behold I am the light and the life of the world, and I have
      drank out of the bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in
      taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in
      all things, from the beginning. And it came to pass that when Jesus had spake these words, the
      whole multitude fell to the earth, for they remembered that it had been prophesied among them
      that Christ should shew himself unto them after his ascension into Heaven. And it came to pass
      that the Lord spake unto them saying: Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your
      hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands, and in my
      feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have
      been slain for the sins of the world. And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and
      thrust their hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails in his hands and in his
      feet; and this they did do, going forth one by one, until they had all gone forth, and did see
      with their eyes, and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety, and did bear record,
      that it was he, of whom it was written by the prophets that should come. And it came to pass
      that when they had all gone forth, and had witnessed for themselves, they did cry out with one
      accord, saying: Hosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God! And they did fall down at
      the feet of Jesus, and did worship him. And it came to pass that he spake unto Nephi, (for
      Nephi was among the multitude,) and he commanded him that he should come forth. And Nephi
      arose and went forth, and bowed himself before the Lord, and he did kiss his feet. --And the
      Lord commanded him that he should arise. And he arose and stood before him. And the Lord said
      unto him, I give unto you power that ye shall baptize this people, when I am again ascended
      into heaven. And again the Lord called others, and said unto them likewise; and he gave unto
      them power to baptize. And he saith unto them, On this wise shall ye baptize; and there shall
      be no disputations among you. Verily I say unto you, that whoso repenteth of his sins through
      your words, and desireth to be baptized in my name, on this wise shall ye baptize them:
      Behold, ye shall go down and stand in the water, and in my name shall ye baptize them. And now
      behold, these are the words which ye shall say, calling them by name, saying: Having authority
      given me of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and the Son, and of the
      Holy Ghost. Amen. And then shall ye immerse them in the water, and come forth again out of the
      water. And after this manner shall ye baptize in my name, for behold, verily I say unto you,
      that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one; and I am in the Father, and the
      Father in me, and the Father and I are one. And according as I have commanded you, thus shall
      ye baptize. And there shall be no disputations among you, as there hath hitherto been; neither
      shall there be disputations among you concerning the points of my doctrine, as there hath
      hitherto been; for verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention, is
      not of me, but is of the Devil, which is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the
      hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another. Behold, this is not my doctrine, to
      stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such
      things should be done away. Behold, verily, verily I say unto you, I will declare unto you my
      doctrine. And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me;
      and I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost
      beareth record of the Father and me, and I bear record that the father commandeth all men,
      every where to repent and believe in me; and whoso believeth in me, and is baptized, the same
      shall be saved; and they are they which shall inherit the kingdom of God. And whoso believeth
      not in me, and is not baptized, shall be damned. --Verily, verily I say unto you, that this is
      my doctrine; and I bear record of it from the Father; and whoso believeth in me, believeth in
      the Father also; and unto him will the Father bear record of me; for he will visit him with
      fire, and with the Holy Ghost; and thus will the Father bear record of me: and the Holy Ghost
      will bear record unto him of the Father and me: for the father, and I, and the Holy Ghost, are
      one. And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and become as a child, and be baptized in my
      name, or ye can in nowise receive these things. And again I say unto you, Ye must repent, and
      be baptized in my name, and become as a little child, or ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom
      of God. Verily, verily I say unto you, that this is my doctrine; and whoso buildeth upon this,
      buildeth upon my rock; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against them. And whoso shall
      declare more or less than this, and establish it for my doctrine, the same cometh of evil, and
      is not built upon my rock, but he buildeth upon a sandy foundation, and the gates of hell
      standeth open to receive such when the floods come, and the winds beat upon them. Therefore go
      forth unto this people and declare the words which I have spoken, unto the ends of the earth.

    <text> And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words unto Nephi, and to those which
      had been called, (now the number of them which had been called, and received power and
      authority to baptize, were twelve,) and behold he stretched forth his hand unto the multitude,
      and cried unto them saying: Blessed are ye, if ye shall give heed unto them saying, Blessed
      are ye, if ye shall give heed unto the words of these twelve which I have chosen from among
      you to minister unto you, and to be your servants; and unto them I have given power, that they
      may baptize you with water; and after that ye are baptized with water, behold I will baptize
      you with fire and with the Holy Ghost; therefore blessed are ye, if ye shall believe in me,
      and be baptized, after that ye have seen me, and know that I am. And again, more blessed are
      they which shall believe in your words, because that ye shall testify that ye have seen me,
      and that ye know that I am. Yea, blessed are they which shall believe in your words, and come
      down into the depths of humility, and be baptized; for they shall be visited with fire and
      with the Holy Ghost, and shall receive a remission of their sins. Yea, blessed are the poor in
      spirit, which cometh unto me, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven. And again, blessed are all
      they that mourn, for they shall be comforted; and blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit
      the earth. And blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall
      be filled with the Holy Ghost. And blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. And
      blessed are all the pure in heart, for they shall see God. And blessed are all the
      peace-makers, for they shall be called the children of God. And blessed are they which are
      persecuted, for my namesake, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven. And blessed are ye when men
      shall revile you, and persecute, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my
      sake, for ye shall have great joy and be exceeding glad, for great shall be your reward in
      Heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. Verily, verily I say unto
      you, I give unto you to be the salt of the earth; but if the salt shall lose its savor,
      wherewith shall the earth be salted? The salt shall be thenceforth good for nothing, but to be
      cast out, and to be trodden under the foot of men. Verily, verily I say unto you, I give unto
      you to be the light of this people. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. Behold, do men
      light a candle and put it under a bushel? Nay, but on a candle-stick, and it giveth light to
      all that are in the house; therefore let your light so shine before this people, that they may
      see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven. Think not that I am come to
      destroy the law or the prophets. I am not come to destroy but to fulfil: for verily I say unto
      you, one jot nor one tittle hath not passed away from the law, but in me it hath all been
      fulfilled. And behold I have given unto you the law and the commandments of my Father, that ye
      shall believe in me, and that ye shall repent of your sins, and come unto me with a broken
      heart and a contrite spirit. Behold, ye have the commandments before you, and the law is
      fulfilled; therefore come unto me and be ye saved; for verily I say unto you, that except ye
      shall keep my commandments, which I have commanded you at this time, ye shall in no case enter
      into the kingdom of heaven. Ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, and it
      is also written before you, that thou shalt not kill; and whosoever kill, shall be in danger
      of the judgment of God. But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother, shall be
      in danger of his judgment. And whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of
      the council; and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire; therefore,
      if ye shall come unto me, or shall desire to come unto me, and rememberest that thy brother
      hath aught against thee, go thy way unto thy brother, and first be reconciled to thy brother,
      and then come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I will receive you. Agree with thine
      adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him, lest any time he shall get thee, and
      thou shalt be cast into prison. Verily, verily I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come
      out thence, until thou hast paid the uttermost senine. --And while ye are in prison, can ye
      pay even one senine? Verily, verily I say unto you, Nay. Behold, it is written by them of old
      time, that thou shalt not commit adultery; but I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a
      woman, to lust after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart. Behold, I give unto
      you a commandment, that ye suffer none of these things to enter into your heart: for it is
      better that ye should deny yourselves of these things, wherein ye shall take up your cross,
      than that ye should be cast into hell. It hath been written, That whosoever shall put away his
      wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement. Verily, verily I say unto you, That whosoever
      shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery;
      and whoso shall marry her who is divorced, committeth adultery. And again it is written, Thou
      shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths. But verily, verily I
      say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by Heaven, for it is God's throne; nor by the earth,
      for it his footstool; neither shalt thou swear by the head, because thou canst not make one
      hair black or white; but let your communications be Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever cometh
      of more than these are evil. And behold, it is written, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a
      tooth. But I say unto you, That ye shall not resist evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on
      thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if any man shall sue thee at the law, and
      take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile,
      go with him twain. Give to him that asketh thee, and to him that would borrow of thee, turn
      thou not away. And behold, it is written also, That thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate
      thine enemy: but behold I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good
      to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you, that ye
      may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the
      evil and on the good; therefore those things which were of old time, which were under the law
      in me, are all fulfilled. --Old things are done away, and all things have become new;
      therefore I would that ye should be perfect even as I your Father which is in Heaven is
      perfect. </text>

    <text> Verily, verily I say that I would that ye should do alms unto the poor; but take heed
      that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your
      Father which is in heaven. Therefore, when ye shall do your alms, do not sound a trumpet
      before you, as will hypocrites do in the synagogues, and in the streets, that they may have
      glory of men. Verily, I say unto you, They have their reward. But when thou doest alms, let
      not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth; that thine alms may be secret: and thy
      Father which seeth in secret, himself shall reward thee openly. And when thou prayest, thou
      shalt not do as hypocrites: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues, and in the
      corner of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily, I say unto you, They have their
      reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door,
      pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward
      thee openly. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen: for they think that
      they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your
      Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him. After this manner therefore pray
      ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy will be done in earth as it is
      in heaven. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into
      temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,
      for ever. Amen. For, if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also
      forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your
      trespasses. Moreover, when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they
      disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily, I say unto you, They
      have their reward. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face; that thou
      appear not unto men, to fast, but unto thy Father, which is in secret: and thy Father, which
      seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth,
      where moth and rust doth corrupt, and thieves break through and steal: but lay up for
      yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do
      not break through nor steal. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. The
      light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full
      of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the
      light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness! No man can serve two masters:
      for either he will hate the one, and love the other. or else he will hold to the one, and
      despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. And now it came to pass that when Jesus had
      spoken these words, he looked upon the twelve whom he had chosen, and saith unto them,
      Remember the words which I have spoken. For behold, ye are they which I have chosen to
      minister unto this people. Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye
      shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the
      life more than meat, and the body than raiment? Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not,
      neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not
      much better than they? Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? And
      why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field how they grow; they toil
      not, neither do they spin; and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon, in all his glory, was
      not arrayed like the one of these. Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which
      to-day is, and to- morrow is cast into the oven, even so will he clothe you, if ye are not of
      little faith. Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, what shall we drink?
      or, wherewithal shall he be clothed? For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all
      these things. --But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these
      things shall be added unto you. Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall
      take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient is the day unto the evil thereof. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words, he turned again to the
      multitude, and did open his mouth unto them again, saying, Verily, verily I say unto you,
      Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and
      with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. And why beholdest thou the mote
      that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Or how
      wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and behold, a beam is
      in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt
      thou see clearly to cast out the mote of thy brother's eye. Give not that which is holy unto
      the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet,
      and turn again and rend you. Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find;
      knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that
      seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened. Or what man is there of you,
      whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a
      serpent? If ye then being evil knoweth how to give good gifts unto your children, how much
      more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? Therefore all
      things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do even so to them: for this is the law
      and the prophets. Enter ye in at the straight gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the
      way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat: because, straight is
      the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.
      Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are
      ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits: Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs
      of thistles? Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth
      forth evil fruit. --A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither a corrupt tree bring
      forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and cast into
      the fire. Wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them. Not every one that saith unto me
      Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father
      which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy
      name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in my name done many wonderful works? And then
      will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. Therefore,
      whoso heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken unto a wise man, which built
      his house upon a rock: and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and
      beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. And every one that
      heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which
      built his house upon the sand: and the rain descended. and the floods came, and the winds
      blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ended these sayings, he cast his eyes round
      about on the multitude, and saith unto them, Behold, ye have heard these things which I have
      taught before I ascended to my Father; therefore whoso remembereth these sayings of mine, and
      doeth them, him will I raise up at the last day. And it came to pass that when Jesus had said
      these words, he perceived that there were some among them which marvelled, and wondered what
      he would concerning the law of Moses: for they understood not the saying, That old things had
      passed away, and that all things had become knew. And he saith unto them, Marvel not that I
      said unto you, that old things had passed away, and that all things had become new. Behold I
      say unto you, That the law is fulfilled that was given unto Moses. Behold, I am he that gave
      the law, and I am he which covenanted with my people Israel; therefore, the law in me is
      fulfilled: for I have come to fulfil the law; therefore, it hath an end. Behold, I do not
      destroy the prophets: for as many as have not been fulfilled in me, verily, I say unto you,
      shall all be fulfilled. And because I said unto you, That old things hath passed away, I do
      not destroy that which hath been spoken concerning things which is to come. For behold, the
      covenant which I have made with my people, is not all fulfilled; but the law which was given
      unto Moses, hath an end in me. Behold, I am the law, and the light: Look unto me, and endure
      to the end, and ye shall live: for unto him that endureth to the end, will I give eternal
      life. Behold, I have given unto you the commandments; therefore keep my commandments. And this
      is the law and the prophets: for they truly testified of me. And now it came to pass that when
      Jesus had spoken these words, he said unto those twelve whom he had chosen, Ye are my
      disciples; and ye are a light unto this people, which are a remnant of the house of Joseph.
      And behold, this is the land of your inheritance; and the Father hath given it unto you. --And
      not at any time hath the Father given me commandment that I should tell it unto your brethren
      at Jerusalem; neither at any time hath the Father given me commandment, that I should tell
      unto them concerning the other tribes of the house of Israel, which the Father hath led away
      out of the land. --This much did the Father command me, That I should tell unto them, that
      other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my
      voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. And now because of stiffneckedness and
      unbelief, they understood not my word; therefore I was commanded to say no more of the Father
      concerning this thing unto them. But, verily, I say unto you, that the Father hath commanded
      me, and I tell it unto you, that ye were separated from among them because of their iniquity;
      therefore it is because of their iniquity, that they know not of you. And verily, I say unto
      you again, That the other tribes hath the father separated from them; and it is because of
      their iniquity, that they know not of them. And verily, I say unto you, That ye are they of
      which I said, other sheep I have, which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they
      shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd. And they understood me
      not, for they supposed it had been the Gentiles: for they understood not that the Gentiles
      should be converted through their preaching; and they understood me not that I said they shall
      hear my voice; and they understood me not that the Gentiles should not at any time hear my
      voice; that I should not manifest myself unto them, save it were by the Holy Ghost. But
      behold, ye have not heard my voice, and seen me; and ye are my sheep, and ye are numbered
      among them which the Father hath given me. </text>

    <text> And verily, verily, I say unto you, That I have other sheep, which are not of this land;
      neither of the land of Jerusalem; neither in any parts of that land round about, whither I
      have been to minister. For they of which I speak, are they which have not as yet heard my
      voice; neither have I at any time manifested myself unto them. But I have received a
      commandment of the Father, That I shall go unto them, and that they shall hear my voice, and
      shall be numbered among my sheep, that there may be one fold, and one shepherd; therefore I go
      to shew myself unto them. And I command you that ye shall write these sayings, after that I am
      gone, that if it so be that my people at Jerusalem, they which have seen me, and been with me
      in my ministry, do not ask the Father in my name, that they may receive a knowledge of you by
      the Holy Ghost, and also of the other tribes which they know not of, that these sayings which
      ye shall write, shall be kept, and shall be manifested unto the Gentiles, that through the
      fulness of the Gentiles, the remnant of their seed which shall be scattered forth upon the
      face of the earth, because of their unbelief, may be brought in, or may be brought to a
      knowledge of me, their Redeemer. And then will I gather them in from the four quarters of the
      earth; and then will I fulfil the covenant which the Father hath made unto all the people of
      the house of Israel. And blessed are the Gentiles, because of their belief in me, in and of
      the Holy Ghost, which witness unto them of me and of the Father. Behold, because of their
      belief in me, saith the Father, and because of the unbelief of you, O house of Israel, in the
      latter day shall the truth come unto the Gentiles, that the fulness of these things shall be
      made known unto them. But Wo, saith the Father, unto the unbelieving of the Gentiles: for
      notwithstanding that they come forth upon the face of this land, and have scattered my people,
      which are of the house of Israel; and my people which are of the house of Israel, have been
      cast out from among them, and have been trodden under feet by them; and because of the mercies
      of the Father unto the Gentiles, and also the judgments of the Father upon my people, which
      are of the house of Israel, verily, verily, I say unto you, That after all this, and I have
      caused my people which are of the house of Israel, to be smitten, and to be afflicted, and to
      be slain, and to be cast out from among them, and to become hated by them. And thus commandeth
      the Father that I should say unto you at that day, When the Gentiles shall sin against my
      Gospel, and shall reject the fulness of my Gospel, and shall be lifted up in the pride of
      their hearts above all nations, and above all the people of the whole earth, and shall be
      filled with all manner of lyings, and of deceits, and of mischiefs, and all manner of
      hypocrisy, and murders, and priestcrafts, and whoredoms, and of secret abominations; and if
      they shall do all these things and shall reject the fulness of my Gospel, behold, saith the
      Father, I will bring the fulness of my Gospel from among them; and then will I remember my
      covenant which I have made unto my people, O house of Israel, and I will bring my Gospel unto
      them; and I will shew unto thee, O house of Israel, that the Gentiles shall not have power
      over you, but I will remember my covenant unto you, O house of Israel, and ye shall come unto
      the knowledge of the fulness of my Gospel. But if the Gentiles will repent, and return unto
      me, saith the Father, behold, they shall be numbered among my people, O house of Israel; and I
      will not suffer my people, which are of the house of Israel, to go through among them, and
      tread them down, saith the Father. But if they will not turn unto me, and hearken unto my
      voice, I will suffer them, yea, I will suffer my people, O house of Israel, that they shall go
      through among them, and shall tread them down, and they shall be as salt that hath lost his
      savour, which is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under
      foot of my people, O house of Israel. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Thus has the Father
      commanded me, that I should give unto this people this land for their inheritance. And when
      the words of the prophet Isaiah shall be fulfilled, which saith, Thy watchmen shall lift up
      the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the
      Lord shall bring again Zion. Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of
      Jerusalem: for the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem. The Lord hath
      made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations: and all the ends of the earth shall see
      the salvation of God. </text>

    <text> Behold, bow it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words, he looked round about
      again on the multitude, and he saith unto them, Behold, my time is at hand. I perceive that ye
      are weak, that ye cannot understand all my words which I am commanded of the father to speak
      unto you at this time; therefore, go ye unto your homes, and ponder upon the things which I
      have said, and ask of the Father, in my name, that ye may understand; and prepare your minds
      for the morrow, and I come unto you again. But now I go unto the Father, and also to shew
      myself unto the lost tribes of Israel: for they are not lost unto the Father, for he knoweth
      whither he hath taken them. And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his
      eyes round about again on the multitude, and beheld they were in tears, and did look
      steadfastly upon him, as if they would ask him to tarry a little while longer with them. And
      he saith unto them, Behold, my bowels is filled with compassion towards you: Have ye any that
      are sick among you, bring them hither. Have ye any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or
      maimed, or leprous, or that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any
      manner, bring them hither, and I will heal them: for I have compassion upon you; my bowels is
      filled with mercy: for I perceive that ye desire that I should shew unto you what I have done
      unto your brethren at Jerusalem: for I see that your faith is sufficient, that I should heal
      you. And it came to pass that when he had thus spoken, all the multitude, with one accord, did
      go forth, with their sick, and their afflicted, and their lame, and with their blind, and with
      their dumb, and with all that they were afflicted in any manner; and he did heal them every
      one as they were brought forth unto him; and they did all, both they which had been healed,
      and they which were whole, bow down at his feet, and did worship him; and as many as could
      come for the multitude did kiss his feet, insomuch that they did bathe his feet with their
      tears. And it came to pass that he commanded that their little children should be brought. So
      they brought their little children and sat them down upon the ground round about him, and
      Jesus stood in the midst; and the multitude gave way till they had all been brought unto him.
      And it came to pass that when they had all been brought, and Jesus stood in the midst, he
      commanded the multitude that they should kneel down upon the ground. And it came to pass that
      when they had knelt upon the ground, Jesus groaned within himself, and saith, Father, I am
      troubled because of the wickedness of the people of the house of Israel. And when he had said
      these words, he himself also knelt upon the earth; and beheld he prayed unto the Father; and
      the things which he prayed, cannot be written, and the multitude did bear record which heard
      him. And after this manner do they bear record; the eye hath never seen, neither hath the ear
      heard, before, so great and marvellous things as we saw and heard Jesus speak unto the Father;
      and no tongue can speak, neither can there be written by any man, neither can the hearts of
      men conceive so great and marvellous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak; and no one
      can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the time we heard him pray for us unto the
      Father. And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of praying unto the Father, he
      arose; but so great was the joy of the multitude, that they were overcome. And it came to pass
      that Jesus spake unto them, and bade them arise. And they arose from the earth, and he saith
      unto them, Blessed are ye because of your faith. And now behold, my joy is full. And when he
      had said these words, he wept, and the multitude bear record of it, and he took their little
      children, one by one, and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them. And when he had
      done this he wept again, and he spake unto the multitude, and saith unto them, Behold your
      little ones. And as they looked to behold, they cast their eyes towards Heaven, and they saw
      the Heavens open, and they saw angels descending out of heaven as it were, in the midst of
      fire; and they came down and encircled those little ones about; and they were encircled with
      fire; and the angels did minister unto them, and the multitude did see and hear, and bear
      record; and they know that their record is true, for they all of them did see and hear, every
      man for himself; and they were in number about two thousand and five hundred souls; and they
      did consist of men, women and children. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that Jesus commanded his disciples that they should bring forth some
      bread and wine unto him. And while they were gone for the bread and wine, he commanded the
      multitude that they should sit themselves down upon the earth. And when the disciples had come
      with the bread and wine, he took of the bread, and blessed it; and he gave unto the disciples,
      and commanded that they should eat. And when they had eat, and were filled, he commanded that
      they should give unto the multitude. And when the multitude had eaten and were filled, he
      saith unto the disciples, Behold, there shall one be ordained among you, and to him will I
      give power that he shall break bread, and bless it, and give it unto the people of my church,
      unto all they which shall believe and be baptized in my name. And this shall ye always observe
      to do, even as I have done, even as I have broken bread, and blessed it, and gave it unto you.
      And this shall ye do in remembrance of my holy body, which I have shewn unto you. --And it
      shall be a testimony unto the Father, that ye do always ways remember me. And if ye do always
      remember me, ye shall have my spirit to be with you. And it came to pass that when he had said
      these words, he commanded his disciples that they should take of the wine of the cup, and
      drink of it, and that they should also give unto the multitude, that they might drink of it.
      And it came to pass that they did so, and did drink of it, and were filled; and they gave unto
      the multitude, and they did drink, and they were filled. And when the disciples had done this,
      Jesus saith unto them, Blessed are ye for this thing which ye have done, for this is
      fulfilling my commandments, and this doth witness unto the Father that ye are willing to do
      that which I have commanded you. And this shall ye always do unto those who repent and are
      baptized in my name; and ye shall do it in rememberance of my blood, which I have shed for
      you, that ye may witness unto the Father that ye do always remember me. And if ye do always
      remember me, ye shall have my spirit to be with you. And I give unto you a commandment that ye
      shall do these things. And if ye shall always do these things, blessed are ye, for ye are
      built upon my rock. But whoso among you shall do more or less than these, are not built upon
      my rock, but are built upon a sandy foundation; and when the rain descends, and the flood
      come, and the winds blow, and beat upon them, they shall fall, and the gates of hell is
      already open to receive them; therefore blessed are ye if ye shall keep my commandments, which
      the Father hath commanded me that I should give unto you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye
      must watch and pray always, lest ye be tempted by the devil, and ye are led away captive by
      him. And as I have prayed among you, even so shall ye pray in my church, among my people which
      do repent and are baptized in my name. Behold I am the light; I have set an example for you.
      And it came to pass that when Jesus had spake these words unto his disciples, he turned again
      unto the mnltitude, and saith unto them, Behold, verily, verily I say unto you, ye must watch
      and pray always, lest ye enter into temptation; for Satan desireth to have you, that he may
      sift you as wheat; therefore ye must always pray unto the Father in my name; and whatsoever ye
      shall ask the Father in my name, which is right, believing that ye shall receive, and behold
      it shall be given unto you. Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name, that
      your wives and your children may be blessed. And behold, ye shall meet together oft, and ye
      shall not forbid any man from coming unto you when ye shall meet together, but suffer them
      that they may come unto you, and forbid them not; but ye shall pray for them, and shall not
      cast them out; and if it so be that they come unto you oft, ye shall pray for them unto the
      Father in my name; therefore hold up your light, that it may shine unto the world. Behold I am
      the light which ye shall hold up --that which ye have seen me do. Behold ye see that I have
      prayed unto the Father, and ye all have witnessed; and ye see that I have commanded that none
      of you should go away, but rather have commanded that ye should come unto me, that ye might
      feel and see; even so shall ye do unto the world; and whosoever breaketh this commandment,
      suffereth himself to be lead into temptation. And now it came to pass that when Jesus had
      spoken these words, he turned his eyes again upon the disciples whom he had chosen, and saith
      unto them, behold, verily, verily I say unto you, I give unto you another commandment, and
      then I must go unto my Father, that I may fulfil other commandments which he hath given me.
      And now behold, this is the commandment which I give unto you, that ye shall not suffer any
      one knowingly, to partake of my flesh, and blood unworthily, when ye shall minister it: For
      whoso eateth and drinketh my flesh and blood unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to his
      soul; therefore if ye know that a man is unworthy to eat and drink of my flesh and blood, ye
      shall forbid him; nevertheless ye shall not cast him out from among you, but ye shall minister
      unto him, and shall pray for him unto the Father, in my name, and if it so be that he
      repenteth, and is baptized in my name, then shall ye receive him, and shall minister unto him
      of my flesh and blood; but if he repenteth not, he shall not be numbered among my people, that
      he may not destroy my people: For behold I know my sheep, and they are numbered; nevertheless
      ye shall not cast him out of your synagogues, or your places of worship, for unto such shall
      ye minister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent, and come unto me with full
      purpose of heart, and I shall heal them, and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto
      them. Therefore keep these sayings which I have commanded you, that ye come not under
      condemnation: For wo unto him whom the Father condemneth. And I give you these commandments,
      because of the disputations which hath been among you beforetime. And blessed are ye if ye
      have no disputations among you. And now I go unto the Father, because it is expedient that I
      should go unto the Father, for your sakes. And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end
      of these sayings, he touched with his hand the disciples whom he had chosen, one by one, even
      until he had touched them all, and spake unto them as he touched them; and the multitude heard
      not the words which he spake, therefore they did not bear record; but the disciples bear
      record that he gave them power to give the Holy Ghost. And I will shew unto you hereafter that
      this record is true. And it came to pass that when Jesus had touched them all, there came a
      cloud and overshadowed the multitude, that they could not see Jesus. And while they were
      overshadowed, he departed from them, and ascended into Heaven. --And the disciples saw and did
      bear record that he ascended again into Heaven. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ascended into Heaven, the multitude did
      disperse, and every man did take his wife and his children, and did return to his own home.
      And it was noised abroad among the people immediately, before it was dark, that the multitude
      had seen Jesus, and that he had ministered unto them, and that he would also show himself on
      the morrow unto the multitude; yea, and even all the night it was noised abroad concerning
      Jesus; and insomuch did they send forth unto the people, that there were many, yea, an
      exceeding great number did labor exceedingly all night, that they might be on the morrow in
      the place where Jesus should shew himself unto the multitude. And it came to pass that on the
      morrow, when the multitude was gathered together, behold Nephi and his brother, whom he had
      raised from the dead, whose name was Timothy, and also his son, whose name was Jonas, and also
      Mathoni, and Mathonihah, his brother, and Kumen, and Kumenonhi, and Jeremiah, and Shemnon, and
      Jonas, and Zedekiah, and Isaiah: Now these were the names of the disciples whom Jesus had
      chosen. And it came to pass that they went forth and stood in the midst of the multitude. And
      behold, the multitude was so great, that they did cause that they should be separated into
      twelve bodies. And the twelve did teach the multitude; and behold, they did cause that the
      multitude should kneel down upon the face of the earth, and should pray unto the Father, in
      the name of Jesus. And the disciples did pray unto the Father also, in the name of Jesus. And
      it came to pass that they arose and ministered unto the people. And when they had ministered
      those same words which Jesus had spoken --nothing varying from the words which Jesus had
      spoken --behold, they knelt again, and prayed to the Father in the name of Jesus; and they did
      pray for that which they most desired; and they desired that the Holy Ghost should be given
      unto them. And when they had thus prayed, they went down unto the water's edge, and the
      multitude followed them. And it came to pass that Nephi went down into the water, and was
      baptized. And he baptized all they whom Jesus had chosen. And it came to pass when they were
      all baptized, and had come up out of the water, the Holy Ghost did fall upon them, and they
      were filled with the Holy Ghost, and with fire. And behold, they were encircled about as if it
      were fire; and it came down from heaven, and the multitude did witness it, and do bear record;
      and angels did come down out of heaven, and did minister unto them. And it came to pass that
      while the angels were ministering unto the disciples, behold, Jesus came and stood in the
      midst, and ministered unto them. And it came to pass that he spake unto the multitude, and
      commanded them that they should kneel down again upon the earth, and also that his disciples
      should kneel down upon the earth. And it came to pass that when they had all knelt down upon
      the earth, he commanded his disciples that they should pray. And behold, they began to pray;
      and they did pray unto Jesus, calling him their Lord and their God. And it came to pass that
      Jesus departed out of the midst of them, and went a little way off from them and bowed himself
      to the earth, and he saith, Father, I thank thee that thou hast given the Holy Ghost unto
      these whom I have chosen; and it is because of their belief in me, that I have chosen them out
      of the world. Father, I pray thee that thou wilt give the Holy Ghost unto all of them that
      shall believe in their words. Father, thou hast given them the Holy Ghost, because they
      believe in me, and thou seest that they believe in me, because thou hearest them, and they
      pray unto me; and they pray unto me because I am with them. And now Father, I pray unto thee
      for them, and also for all they which shall believe on their words, that they may believe in
      me, that I may be in them as thou, Father, art in me, that we may be one. And it came to pass,
      that when Jesus had thus prayed unto the Father, he came unto his disciples, and behold they
      did still continue, without ceasing, to pray unto him; and they did not multiply many words,
      for it was given unto them what they should pray, and they were filled with desire. And it
      came to pass that Jesus blessed them, as they did pray unto him, and his countenance did smile
      upon them, and the light of his countenance did shine upon them, and behold they were as white
      as the countenance, and also the garments of Jesus; and behold the whiteness thereof did
      exceed all the whiteness, yea, even there could be nothing upon the earth so white as the
      whiteness thereof. And Jesus saith unto them, Pray on, nevertheless they did not cease to
      pray. And he turned from them again, and went a little way off, and bowed himself to the
      earth; and he prayed again unto the Father, saying: Father, I thank thee that thou hast
      purified those which I have chosen, because of their faith, and I pray for them, and also for
      them which shall believe on their words, that they may be purified in me, through faith on
      their words, even as they are purified in me. Father, I pray not for the world, but for them
      which thou hast given unto me out of the world, because of their faith, that they may be
      purified in me, that I may be in them as thou, Father, art in me, that we may be one, that I
      may be glorified in them. And it came to pass that when Jesus had spake these words, he came
      again unto his disciples, and behold they did pray steadfastly, without ceasing unto him; and
      he did smile upon then again; and behold they were white, even as Jesus. And it came to pass
      that he went again a little way off, and prayed unto the Father; and tongue cannot speak the
      words which he prayed, neither can be written by man the words which he prayed. And the
      multitude did hear, and do bear record, and their hearts were open, and they did understand in
      their hearts the words which he prayed. Nevertheless, so great and marvellous were the words
      which he prayed, that they cannot be written, neither can they be utttered by man. And it came
      to pass that when Jesus had made an end of praying, he came again to the disciples, and saith
      unto them, So great faith have I never seen among all the Jews; wherefore I could not shew
      unto them so great miracles, because of their unbelief. Verily I say unto you, there are none
      of them that have seen so great things as ye have seen; neither have they heard so great
      things as ye have heard. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that he commanded the multitude that they should cease to pray, and
      also his disciples. And he commanded them that they should not cease to pray in their hearts.
      And he commanded them that they should arise and stand up upon their feet. And they arose up
      and stood upon their feet. And it came to pass that he break bread again, and blessed it, and
      gave to the disciples to eat. And when they had eat, he commanded them that they should break
      bread, and give unto the multitude. And when they had given unto the multitude, he also gave
      them wine to drink, and commanded them that they should give unto the multitude. Now there had
      been no bread, neither wine, brought by the disciples, neither by the multitude; but he truly
      gave unto them bread to eat, and also wine to drink; and he saith unto them, He that eateth
      this bread, eateth of my body to their soul, and he that drinketh of this wine, drinketh of my
      blood to their soul, and their soul shall never hunger nor thirst, but shall be filled. Now
      when the multitude had all eat and drank, behold they were filled with the spirit, and they
      did cry out with one voice, and gave glory to Jesus, whom they both saw and heard. And it came
      to pass that when they had all given glory unto Jesus, he saith unto them, Behold now I finish
      the commandment which the Father hath commanded me concerning this people, which are a remnant
      of the house of Israel. Ye remember that I spake unto you, and said that when the words of
      Isaiah should be fulfilled: Behold they are written, ye have them before you; therefore search
      them. And verily, verily I say unto you, that when they shall be fulfilled, then is the
      fulfilling of the covenant which the Father hath made unto his people. O house of Israel, and
      then shall the remnants which shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the earth, be
      gathered in from the east, and from the west, and from the south, and from the north; and they
      shall be brought to the knowledge of the Lord their God, who hath redeemed them. And the
      Father hath commanded me that I should give unto you this land, for your inheritance. And I
      say unto you, that if the Gentiles do not repent after the blessing which they shall receive,
      after that they have scattered my people, then shall ye which are a remnant of the house of
      Jacob, go forth among them; and ye shall be in the midst of them, which shall be many; and ye
      shall be among them, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, and as a young lion among the
      flocks of sheep, who, if he goeth through, both treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and none
      can deliver. Thy hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall
      be cut off. And I will gather my people together, as a man gathereth his sheaves into the
      floor: for I will make my people with whom the Father hath covenanted, yea, I will make thy
      horn iron, and I will make thy hoops brass. And thou shalt beat in pieces many people; and I
      will consecrate their gain unto the Lord, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole
      earth. And behold, I am he which doeth it. And it shall come to pass, saith the Father, That
      the sword of my justice shalt hang over them at that day; and except they repent, it shall
      fall upon them, saith the Father, yea, even upon all the nations of the Gentiles. --And it
      shall come to pass that I will establish my people, O house of Israel. And behold, this people
      will I establish in this land, unto the fulfilling of the covenant which I made with your
      Father Jacob; and it shall be a new Jerusalem. And the powers of heaven shall be in the midst
      of this people; yea, even I will be in the midst of you. Behold, I am he of whom Moses spake,
      saying: A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me:
      him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass
      that every soul which will not hear that prophet, shall be cut off from among the people.
      Verily, I say unto you, Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel. and those that follow after, as
      many as have spoken, have testified of me. And behold, ye are the children of the prophets;
      and ye are of the house of Israel; and ye are of the covenant which the Father made with your
      fathers, saying: Unto Abraham, and in thy seed, shall all the kindreds of the earth be
      blessed: the Father having raised me up unto you first, and sent me to bless you, in turning
      away every one of you from his iniquities; and this because ye are the children of the
      covenant. --And after that ye were blessed, then fulfilleth the Father the covenant which he
      made with Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed, unto
      the pouring out of the Holy Ghost through me upon the Gentiles, which blessing upon the
      Gentiles, shall make them mighty above all, unto the scattering of my people, O house of
      Israel; and they shall be scourge unto the people of this land. Nevertheless, when they shall
      have received the fulness of my Gospel, then if they shall harden their hearts against me, I
      will return their iniquities upon their heads, saith the Father. And I will remember the
      covenant which I have made with my people: and I have covenanted with them, that I would
      gather them together in mine own due time; that I would give unto them again the land of their
      fathers, for their inheritance, which is the land of Jerusalem, which is the promised land
      unto them forever, saith the Father. And it shall come to pass that the time cometh, when the
      fulness of my gospel shall be preached unto them, and they shall believe in me, that I am
      Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and shall pray unto the Father in my name. Then shall their
      watchmen lift up their voice; and with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see
      eye to eye. Then will the Father gather them together again, and give unto them Jerusalem for
      the land of their inheritance. Then shall they break forth into joy --sing together, ye waste
      places of Jerusalem: for the Father hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem. The
      Father hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations: and all the ends of the
      earth shall see the salvation of the Father; and the Father and I are one. --And then shall be
      brought to pass that which is writen: Awake, awake again, and put on thy strength, O Zion; put
      on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem. the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come
      into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean. Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, O
      Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive of Zion. For thus saith the
      Lord, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money. Verily,
      verily, I say unto you, That my people shall know my name; yea, in that day they shall know
      that I am he that doth speak. And then shall they say, How beautiful upon the mountains are
      the feet of him that bringeth good tidings unto them, that publisheth peace; that bringeth
      good tidings unto them of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God
      reigneth! And then shall a cry go forth, Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch
      not that which is unclean; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels
      of the Lord. For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the Lord will go before
      you; and the God of Israel shall be your reward. Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he
      shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high. As many were astonished at thee; (his visage
      was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:) so shall he sprinkle
      many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had been told them
      shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider. Verily, verily, I say
      unto you, All these things shall surely come, even as the Father hath commanded me. Then shall
      this covenant which the Father hath covenanted with his people, be fulfilled; and then shall
      Jerusalem be inhabited again with my people: and it shall be the land of their inheritance.

    <text> And verily, I say unto you, I give unto you a sign, that ye may know the time when these
      things shall be about to take place, that I shall gather in from their long dispersion, my
      people, O house of Israel, and shall establish again among them my Zion. And behold, this is
      the thing which I will give unto you for a sign: for verily, I say unto you, That when these
      things which I declare unto you hereafter of myself, and by the power of the Holy Ghost, which
      shall be given unto you of the Father, shall be made known unto the Gentiles, that they may
      know concerning this people which are a remnant of the house of Jacob, and concerning this my
      people which shall be scattered by them; verily, verily, I say unto you, When these things
      shall be made known unto them of the Father, and shall come forth of the Father from them unto
      you: for it is wisdom in the Father that they should be established in this land, and be set
      up as a free people by the power of the Father, that these things might come forth from them
      unto a remnant of your seed, that the covenant of the Father may be fulfilled which he hath
      covenanted with his people, O house of Israel; therefore, when these works, and the works
      which shall be wrought among you hereafter, shall come forth from the Gentiles unto your seed,
      which shall dwindle in unbelief because of iniquity: for thus it behooveth the Father that it
      should come forth from the Gentiles, that he may shew forth his power unto the Gentiles, for
      this cause, that the Gentiles, if they will not harden their hearts, that they may repent and
      come unto me, and be baptized in my name, and know of the true points of my doctrine, that
      they may be numbered among my people, O house of Israel; and when these things come to pass,
      that thy seed shall begin to know these things, it shall be a sign unto them, that they may
      know that the work of the Father hath already commenced unto the fulfilling of the covenant
      which he hath made unto the people which are of the house of Israel. And when that day shall
      come, it shall come to pass that kings shall shut their mouths: for that which had not been
      told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider. For in that
      day, for my sake shall the Father work a work, which shall be a great and a marvellous work
      among them; and there shall be among them which will not believe it, although a man shall
      declare it unto them. But behold, the life of my servant shall be in my hand; therefore they
      shall not hurt him, although he shall be marred because of them. Yet I will heal him, for I
      will shew unto them that my wisdom is greater than the cunning of the Devil. Therefore it
      shall come to pass, that whosoever will not believe in my words, which am Jesus Christ, which
      the Father shall cause him to bring forth unto the Gentiles, and shall give unto him power
      that he shall bring them forth unto the Gentiles, (it shall be done even as Moses said,) they
      shall be cut off from among my people which are of the covenant; and my people which are a
      remnant of Jacob, shall be among the Gentiles, yea, in the midst of them, as a lion among the
      beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who if he go through, both
      treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver. Their hand shall be lifted up upon
      their adversaries, and all their enemies shall be cut off. Yea, wo be unto the Gentiles,
      except they repent: for it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Father, that I will cut
      off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots, and I will cut off
      the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds; and I will cut off witchcarfts
      out of thy hand, and thou shalt have no more soothsayers: thy graven images I will also cut
      off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the
      works of thy hand; and I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee; so will I destroy
      thy cities. And it shall come to pass that all lyings, and deceivings, and envyings, and
      strifes, and priestcrafts, and whoredoms, shall be done away. For it shall come to pass, saith
      the Father, that at that day, whosoever will not repent and come unto my beloved Son, them
      will I cut off from among my people, O house of Israel; and I will execute vengeance and fury
      upon them, even as upon the heathen, such as they have not heard. But if they will repent, and
      hearken unto my words, and harden not their hearts, I will establish my church among them, and
      they shall come in unto the covenant, and be numbered among this the remnant of Jacob, unto
      whom I have given this land for their inheritance, and they shall assist my people, the
      remnant of Jacob; and also, as many of the house of Israel as shall come, that they may build
      a city, which shall be called the New Jerusalem; and then shall they assist my people that
      they may be gathered in, which are scattered upon all the face of the land, in unto the New
      Jerusalem. And then shall the power of heaven come down among them; and I also will be in the
      midst: and then shall the work of the Father commence, at that day even when this Gospel shall
      be preached among the remnant of this people. Verily, I say unto you, At that day shall the
      work of the Father commence among all the dispersed of my people; yea, even the tribes which
      have been lost, which the Father hath led away out of Jerusalem. Yea, the work shall commence
      among all the dispersed of my people, with the Father, to prepare the way whereby they may
      come unto me, that they may call on the Father in my name; yea, and then shall the work
      commence, with the Father, among all nations, in preparing the way whereby his people may be
      gathered home to the land of their inheritance. And they shall go out from all nations; and
      they shall not go out in haste, nor go by flight: for I will go before them, saith the Father,
      and I will be their rereward. </text>

    <text> And then shall that which is written come to pass. Sing, O barren, thou that didst not
      bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for
      more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the Lord.
      Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy inhabitations;
      spare not, lengthen thy cords. and strengthen thy stakes; for thou shalt break forth on the
      right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate
      cities to be inhabited. Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded:
      for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt
      not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more. For thy Maker, thy husband, The Lord of
      hosts is his name; and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole earth shall
      he be called. For the Lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and a
      wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God. For a small amount have I forsaken thee;
      but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a
      moment; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer.
      For this, the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no
      more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee. For the mountains
      shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither
      shall the covenant of my people be removed, saith the Lord that hath mercy on thee. O thou
      afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted! behold, I will lay the stones with fair
      colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires. And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy
      gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones. And all thy children shall be
      taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children. In righteousness thou shalt
      be established: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror;
      for it shall not come near thee. Behold, they shall surely gather together against thee, not
      by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake. Behold, I have
      created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument
      for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy. No weapon that is formed against thee
      shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn.
      This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is of me, saith the
      Lord. </text>

    <text> And now behold I say unto you, That ye had ought to search these things. Yea, a
      commandment I give unto you, that ye search these things diligently: for great is the words of
      Isaiah. For surely he spake as touching all things concerning my people which are of the house
      of Israel; therefore it must needs be that he must speak also to the Gentiles. And all things
      that he spake, hath been, and shall be, even according to the words which he spake. Therefore
      give heed to my words: write the things which I have told you; and according to the time and
      the will of the Father, they shall go forth unto the Gentiles. And whosoever will hearken unto
      my words, and repenteth, and is baptized, the same shall be saved. Search the prophets: for
      many there be that testify of these things. And now it came to pass that when Jesus had said
      these words, he saith unto them again, after he had expounded all the Scriptures unto them
      which they had received, he saith unto the, Behold, other Scriptures I would that ye should
      write, that ye have not. And it came to pass that he said unto Nephi, Bring forth the record
      which ye have kept. And when Nephi had brought forth the records, and laid them before him, he
      cast his eyes upon them, and saith, Verily, I say unto you, I commanded my servant Samuel, the
      Lamanite, that he should testify unto this people, that at the day that the Father should
      glorify his name in me, that there were many saints which should arise from the dead, and
      should appear unto many, and should minister unto them. And he saith unto them, Were it not
      so? And his disciples answered him and said, Yea, Lord, Samuel did prophesy according to thy
      words, and they were fulfilled. And Jesus saith unto them, How be it that ye have not written
      this thing, that many saints did arise and appear unto many, and did minister unto them? And
      it came to pass that Nephi remembered that this thing had not been written. And it came to
      pass that Jesus commanded that it should be written; therefore it was written according as he
      commanded. And now it came to pass that when Jesus had expounded all the Scriptures in one,
      which they had written, he commanded them that they should teach the things which he had
      expounded unto them. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that he commanded them that they should write the words which the
      Father had given unto Malachi, which he should tell unto them. And it came to pass that after
      they were written, he expounded them. And these are the words which he did tell unto them,
      saying: Thus said the Father unto Malachi: Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall
      prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even
      the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of
      hosts. But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he
      is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap. And he shall sit as a refiner and purifyer
      of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they
      may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. --Then shall the offering of Judah and
      Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in former years. And I will
      come near to you to judgment: and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against
      the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his
      wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger, and fear not me, saith
      the Lord of hosts. For I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not
      consumed. Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have
      not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the Lord of hosts. But ye
      said, Wherein shall we return? Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein
      have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed
      me, even this whole nation. Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be
      meat in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you
      the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to
      receive it. And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits
      of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the
      Lord of hosts. And all the nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land,
      saith the Lord of hosts. Your words have been stout against me, saith the Lord. --Yet ye say,
      What have we spoken against thee? Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what doth it
      profit that we have kept his ordinances, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of
      hosts? And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, them
      that tempt God are even delivered. Then they that fear the Lord spake often one to another:
      and the Lord hearkened, and heard: and a book of remembrance was written before him for them
      that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name. And they shall be mine, saith the Lord
      of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his
      own son that serveth him. Then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the
      wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not. </text>

      that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord
      of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name,

      under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord of hosts.
      Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel,
      with the statutes and judgments. Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming
      of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the
      children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with

    <text> And now it came to pass that when Jesus had told these things, he expounded them unto the
      multitude: and he did expound all things unto them, both great and small. And he saith, These
      Scriptures which ye had not with you, the Father commanded that I should give unto you: for it
      was wisdom in him that they should be given unto future generations. And he did expound all
      things, even from the beginning until the time that he should come in his glory; yea, even all
      things which should come upon the face of the earth, even until the elements should melt with
      fervent heat, and the earth should be wrapt together as a scroll, and the heavens and the
      earth should pass away; and even unto the great and last day, when all the people, and all
      kindreds, and all nations and tongues shall stand before God, to be judged of their works,
      whether they be good or whether they be evil: if they be good, to the resurrection of
      everlasting life; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of damnation, being on a parallel,
      the one on the one hand, and the other on the other hand, according to the mercy, and the
      justice, and the holiness which is in Christ, which was before the world began. And now there
      cannot be written in this book, even a hundredth part of the things which Jesus did truly
      teach unto the people; but behold the plates of Nephi do contain the more part of the things
      which he taught the people; and these things have I written, which are a lesser part of the
      things which he taught the people; and I have wrote them to the intent that they may be
      brought again unto this people, from the Gentiles, according to the words which Jesus hath
      spoken.--And when they shall have received this, which is expedient that they should have
      first, to try their faith: And if it shall so be that they shall believe these things, then
      shall the greater things be made manifest unto them. And if it so be that they will not
      believe these things, then shall the greater things be withheld from them, unto their
      condemnation. Behold I were about to write them all which were engraven upon the plates of
      Nephi, but the Lord forbid it, saying, I will try the faith of my people; therefore I, Mormon,
      do write the things which have been commanded me of the Lord. And now I Mormon, make an end of
      my sayings, and proceed to write the things which have been commanded me; therefore I would
      that ye should behold that the Lord truly did teach the people, for the space of three days;
      and after that, he did shew himself unto them oft, and did break bread oft, and bless it, and
      gave it unto them. And it came to pass that he did teach and minister unto the children of the
      multitude of whom hath been spoken, and he did loose their tongues, and they did speak unto
      their fathers great and marvellous things, even greater than he had revealed unto the people,
      and loosed their tongues that they could utter. And it came to pass that after he had ascended
      into Heaven the second time that he shewed himself unto them, and gone unto the Father, after
      having healed all their sick, and their lame, and opened the eyes of their blind, and
      unstopped the ears of the deaf, and even had done all manner of cures among them, and raised a
      man from the dead, and had shewn forth his power unto them, and had ascended unto the Father,
      behold, it came to pass on the morrow, that the multitude gathered themselves together, and
      they both saw and heard these children; yea, even babes did open their mouths, and utter
      marvellous things; and the things which they did utter were forbidden, that there should not
      any man write them. And it came to pass that the disciples whom Jesus had chosen, began from
      that time forth to baptize and to teach as many as did come unto them; and as many as were
      baptized in the name of Jesus, were filled with the Holy Ghost. And many of them saw and heard
      unspeakable things, which are not lawful to be written; and they taught, and did minister one
      to another; and they had all things common among them, every man dealing justly, one with
      another. And it came to pass that they did do all things, even as Jesus had commanded them.
      And they which were baptized in the name of Jesus, were called the church of Christ. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that as the disciples of Jesus were journeying, and were preaching
      the things which they had both heard and seen, and were baptizing in the name of Jesus, it
      came to pass that the disciples were gathered together, and were united in mighty prayer and
      fasting. And Jesus again shewed himself unto them: for they were praying unto the Father, in
      his name; and Jesus came and stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, What will ye
      that I shall give unto you? And they said unto him, Lord, we will that thou wouldst tell us
      the name whereby we shall call this church; for there are disputations among the people
      concerning this matter. And the Lord said unto them, Verily, verily I say unto you, why is it
      that the people should murmur and dispute because of this thing? have they not read the
      scriptures, which saith ye must take upon you the name of Christ, which is in my name? for by
      this name shall ye be called at the last day; and whoso taketh upon him my name, and endureth
      to the end, the same shall be saved at the last day; therefore, whatsoever ye shall do, ye
      shall do it in my name; therefore ye shall call the church in my name; and ye shall call upon
      the Father in my name, that he will bless the church for my sake; and how be it my church,
      save it be called in my name? for if a church be called in Moses' name, then it be Moses'
      church: or if it be called in the name of a man, then it be the church of a man; but if it be
      called in my name, then it is my church, if it so be that they are built upon my Gospel.
      Verily, I say unto you, that ye are built upon my Gospel; therefore ye shall call whatsoever
      things ye do call in my name; therefore if ye call upon the Father, for the church, if it be
      in my name, the Father will hear you; and if it so be that the church is built upon my Gospel,
      then will the Father shew forth his own works in it; but if it be not built upon my Gospel,
      and is built upon the works of men, or upon the works of the devil, verily I say unto you,
      they have joy in their works for a season, and by and by the end cometh, and they are hewn
      down and cast into the fire, from whence there is no return; for their works do follow them:
      for it is because of their works that they are hewn down; therefore remember the things that I
      have told you. Behold I have given unto you my Gospel, and this is the Gospel which I have
      given unto you: That I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent
      me; and my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I have been
      lifted up upon the cross, I might draw all men unto me; that as I have been lifted up by men,
      even so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before me, to be judged of their
      works, whether they be good or whether they be evil; and for this cause have I been lifted up;
      therefore, according to the power of the Father, I will draw all men unto me, that they may be
      judged according to their works. And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is
      baptized in my name, shall be filled; and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold
      guiltless before my Father, at that day when I shall stand to judge the world. And he that
      endureth not unto the end, the same is he that is also hewn down and cast into the fire, from
      whence they can no more return, because of the justice of the Father; and this is the word
      which he hath given unto the children of men. And for this cause he fulfilleth the words which
      he hath given, and he lieth not, but fulfilleth all his words; and no unclean thing can enter
      into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his rest, save it be those who have washed
      their garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and
      their faithfulness unto the end. Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the
      earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may be sanctified by the reception
      of the Holy Ghost, that ye may stand spotless before me at the last day. Verily, verily I say
      unto you, this is my Gospel; and ye know the things that ye must do in my church; for the
      works which ye have seen me do, that shall ye also do; for the works which ye have seen me do,
      even that shall ye do; therefore if ye do these things, blessed are ye, for ye shall be lifted
      up at the last day. Write the things which ye have seen and heard, save it be those which are
      forbidden; write the works of this people, which shall be even as hath been written of that
      which hath been; for behold, out of the books which have been written, and which shall be
      written, shall this people be judged: for by them shall their works be known unto men. And
      behold, all things are written by the Father; therefore out of the books which shall be
      written shall the world be judged. And know ye that ye shall be judges of this people,
      according to the judgment which I shall give unto you, which shall be just; therefore what
      manner of men had ye ought to be? --Verily I say unto you, Even as I am. And now I go unto the
      Father. And verily I say unto you, whatsoever things ye shall ask the Father, in my name, it
      shall be given unto you; therefore ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened
      unto you: for he that asketh, receiveth, and unto him that knocketh, it shall be opened. And
      now behold, my joy is great, even unto fulness, because of you, and also this generation; yea,
      and even the Father rejoiceth, and also all the holy angels, because of you and this
      generation: for none of them are lost. Behold, I would that ye should understand; for I mean
      them which are now alive, of this generation; and none of them are lost; and in them I have
      fulness of joy. --But behold, it sorroweth me because of the fourth generation from this
      generation, for they are led away captive by him, even as was the son of perdition; for they
      will sell me for silver, and for gold, and for that which moth doth corrupt, and which thieves
      can break through and steal. And in that day will I visit them, even in turning their works
      upon their own heads. And it came to pass that when Jesus had ended these sayings, he saith
      unto his disciples, Enter ye in at the straight gate: for straight is the gate, and narrow is
      the way that leads to life, and few there be that find it: But wide is the gate, and broad the
      way which leads to death, and many there be that traveleth therein, until the night cometh,
      wherein no man can work. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass when Jesus had said these words, he spake unto his disciples, one by
      one, saying unto them, What is it that ye desire of me, after I am gone to the Father? And
      they all spake, save it were three, saying, We desire that after we have lived unto the age of
      man, that our ministry, wherein thou hast called us, may have an end, that we may speedily
      come unto thee, in thy kingdom. And he saith unto them, Blessed are ye, because ye desired
      this thing of me; therefore after that ye are seventy and two years old, ye shall come unto me
      in my kingdom, and with me ye shall find rest. And when he spake unto them, he turned himself
      unto the three, and said unto them, What will ye that I should do unto you, when I am gone
      unto the Father? And they sorrowed in their hearts, for they durst not speak unto him the
      thing which they desired. And he saith unto them, Behold, I know your thoughts, and ye have
      desired the thing which John, my beloved, which was with me in my ministry, before that I was
      lifted up by the Jews, desired of me; therefore more blessed are ye, for ye shall never taste
      of death, but ye shall live to behold all the doings of the Father, unto the children of men,
      even until things shall be fulfilled, according to the will of the Father, when I shall come
      in my glory, with the powers of heaven; and ye shall never endure the pains of death; but when
      I shall come in my glory, ye shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye, from mortality to
      immortality; and then shall ye be blessed in the kingdom of my Father. --And again, ye shall
      not have pain while ye shall dwell in the flesh, neither sorrow, save it be for the sins of
      the world; and all this will I do because of the thing which ye have desired of me: for ye
      have desired that ye might bring souls of men unto me, while the world shall stand; and for
      this cause ye shall have fulness of joy; and ye shall sit down in the kingdom of my Father;
      yea, your joy shall be full, even as the Father hath given me fulness of joy; and ye shall be
      even as I am; and I am even as the Father; and the Father and I are one; and the Holy Ghost
      beareth record of the Father and me; and the Father giveth the Holy Ghost unto the children of
      men because of me. And it came to pass that when Jesus had spake these words, he touched every
      one of them with his finger, save it were the three which were to tarry, and then he departed.
      And behold, the heavens were opened, and they were caught up into heaven, and saw and heard
      unspeakable things. And it was forbidden them that they should utter; neither was it given
      unto them power that they could utter the things which they saw and heard; and whether they
      were in the body or out of the body, they could not tell: for it did seem unto them like a
      transfiguration of them, that they were changed from this body of flesh, into an immortal
      state, that they could behold the things of God. But it came to pass that they did again
      minister upon the face of the earth; nevertheless they did not minister of the things which
      they had heard and seen, because of the commandment which was given them in heaven. And now
      whether they were mortal or immortal, from the day of their transfiguration, I know not; but
      this much I know: According to the record which hath been given, they did go forth upon the
      face of the land, and did minister unto all the people, uniting as many to the church as would
      believe in their preaching; baptizing them; and as many as were baptized, did receive the Holy
      Ghost; and they were cast into prison by them who did not belong to the church. And the
      prisons could not hold them, for they were rent in twain, and they were cast down into the
      earth. But they did not smite the earth with the word of God, insomuch that by his power they
      were delivered out of the depths of the earth; and therefore they could not dig pits
      sufficiently to hold them. And thrice they were cast into the furnace, and received no harm.
      And twice were they cast into a den of wild beasts; and behold they did play with the beasts,
      as a child with a sucking lamb, and received no harm. And it came to pass that thus they did
      go forth among all the people of Nephi, and did preach the gospel of Christ unto all people
      upon the face of the land: And they were converted unto the Lord, and were united unto the
      church of Christ: And thus the people of that generation were blessed, according to the word
      of Jesus. And now I, Mormon, make an end of speaking concerning these things, for a time.
      Behold, I were about to write the names of those who were never to taste of death; but the
      Lord forbade, therefore I write them not, for they are hid from the world. But behold I have
      seen them, and they have ministered unto me; and behold they will be among the Gentiles, and
      the Gentiles knoweth them not. They will also be among the Jews, and the Jews shall know them
      not. And it shall come to pass, when the Lord seeth fit in his wisdom, that they shall
      minister unto all the scattered tribes of Israel, and unto all nations, kindred, tongues and
      people, and shall bring out of them unto Jesus many souls, that their desire may be fulfilled,
      and also because of the convincing power of God which is in them, and they are as the angels
      of God and if they shall pray unto the Father in the name of Jesus they can shew themselves
      unto whatsoever man it seemeth them good; therefore great and marvellous works shall be
      wrought by them, before the great and coming day, when all people must surely stand before the
      judgment seat of Christ; yea, even among the Gentiles shall there be a great and marvellous
      work wrought by them, before that judgment day. --And if ye had all the scriptures which gives
      an account of all the marvellous works of Christ, ye would, according to the words of Christ,
      know that these things must surely come. --And wo be unto him that will not hearken unto the
      words of Jesus, and also to them which he hath chosen and sent among them: for whoso receiveth
      not the words of Jesus, and the words of them which he hath sent, receiveth not him; and
      therefore he will not receive them at the last day; and it would be better for them of they
      had not been born. For do ye suppose that ye can get rid of the justice of an offended God,
      who hath been trampled under feet of men, that thereby salvation might come? And now behold,
      as I spake concerning them whom the Lord had chosen, yea, even three which were caught up into
      the Heavens, that I knew not whether they were cleansed from mortality to immortality: --But
      behold, since I wrote, I have inquired of the Lord, and he hath made it manifest unto me, that
      there must needs be a change wrought upon their bodies, or else it needs be that they must
      taste of death; therefore that they might not taste of death, there was a change wrought upon
      their bodies, that they might not suffer pain nor sorrow, save it were for the sins of the
      world. Now this change was not equal to that which should take place at the last day, but
      there was a change wrought upon them, insomuch that Satan could have no power over them, that
      he could not tempt them, and they were sanctified in the flesh, that they were holy, and that
      the powers of the earth could not hold them; and in this state they were to remain until the
      judgment day of Christ; and at that day they were to receive a greater change, and to be
      received into the kingdom of the Father, to go no more out, but to dwell with God eternally in
      the Heavens. </text>

    <text> And now behold, I say unto you, that when the Lord shall see fit, in his wisdom, that
      these sayings shall come unto the Gentiles, according to his word, then ye may know that the
      covenant which the Father hath made with the children of Israel, concerning their restoration
      to the lands of their inheritance, is already beginning to be fulfilled; and ye may know that
      the words of the Lord, which have been spoken by the holy prophets, shall be fulfilled; and ye
      need not say that the Lord delays his coming unto the children of Israel; and ye need not
      imagine in your hearts, that the words which have been spoken are vain, for behold, the Lord
      will remember his covenant which he hath made unto his people of the house of Israel. And when
      ye shall see these sayings coming forth among you, then ye need not any longer spurn at the
      doings of the Lord, for the sword of his justice is in his right hand, and behold at that day,
      if ye shall spurn at his doings, he will cause it that it shall soon overtake you. Wo unto him
      that spurneth at the doings of the Lord; yea, wo unto him that shall deny the Christ, and his
      works; yea, wo unto him that shall deny the revelations of the Lord, and that shall say, the
      Lord no longer worketh by revelation, or by prophecy, or by gifts, or by tongues, or by
      healings, or by the power of the Holy Ghost; yea, and wo unto him that shall say at that day,
      that there can be no miracle wrought by Jesus Christ, for to get gain; for he that doeth this,
      shall become like unto the son of perdition, for whom there was no mercy, according to the
      word of Christ.Yea, and ye need not any longer hiss, nor spurn, nor make game of the Jews, nor
      any of the remnant of the house of Israel, for behold the Lord remembereth his covenant unto
      them, and he will do unto them according to that which he hath sworn; therefore ye need not
      suppose that ye can turn the right hand of the Lord unto the left, that he may not execute
      judgment unto the fulfilling of the covenant which he hath made unto the house of Israel.

    <text> And it came to pass that the thirty and fourth year passed away, and also the thirty and
      fifth, and behold the disciples of Jesus had formed a church of Christ in all the lands round
      about. And as many as did come unto them, and did truly repent of their sins, were baptized in
      the name of Jesus; and they did also receive the Holy Ghost. And it came to pass in the thirty
      and sixth year, the people were all converted unto the Lord, upon all the face of the land,
      both Nephites and Lamanites, and there were no contentions and disputations among them, and
      every man did deal justly one with another. And they had all things common among them;
      therefore there were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made free, and
      partakers of the Heavenly gift. And it came to pass that the thirty and seventh year passed
      away also, and there still continued to be peace in the land. And there were great and
      marvelous works wrought by the disciples of Jesus, insomuch that they did heal the sick, and
      raise the dead, and cause the lame to walk, and the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf
      to hear; and all manner of miracles did they work among the children of men; and in nothing
      did they work miracles save it were in the name of Jesus. And thus did the thirty and eighth
      year pass away, and also the thirty and ninth, and forty and first, and the forty and second,
      yea, even until forty and nine years had passed away, and also the fifty and first, and the
      fifty and second; yea, and even until fifty and nine years had passed away. And the Lord did
      prosper them exceedingly in the land; yea, insomuch that they did build cities again where
      there had been cities burned. Yea, even that great city Zarahemla did they cause to be built
      again. But there were many cities which had been sunk, and waters came up in the stead
      thereof; therefore these cities could not be renewed. And now, behold, it came to pass that
      the people of Nephi did wax strong, and did multiply exceedingly fast, and became an
      exceedingly fair and delightsome people. And they were married, and given in marriage, and
      were blessed according to the multitude of the promises which the Lord had made unto them. And
      they did not walk any more after the performances and ordinances of the law of Moses; but they
      did walk after the commandments which they had received from their Lord and their God,
      continuing in fasting and prayer, and in meeting together oft both to pray and to hear the
      word of the Lord. And it came to pass that there was no contention among all the people, in
      all the land; but there were mighty miracles wrought among the disciples of Jesus. And it came
      to pass that the seventy and first year passed away, and also the seventy and second year,
      yea, and in fine, till the seventy and ninth year had passed away; yea, even an hundred years
      had passed away, and the disciples of Jesus, whom he had chosen, had all gone to the paradise
      of God, save it were the three who should tarry; and there were other disciples ordained in
      their stead; and also many of that generation had passed away. And it came to pass that there
      was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the
      people. And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumult, nor whoredoms, nor lyings, nor
      murders, nor any manner of lasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people
      among all the people who had been created by the hand of God. There were no robbers, nor no
      murderers, neither were there Lamanites, nor no manner of -ites; but they were in one, the
      children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God. And how blessed were they! For the Lord
      did bless them in all their doings; yea, even they were blessed and prospered until an hundred
      and ten years had passed away; and the first generation from Christ had passed away, and there
      was no contention in all the land. And it came to pass that Nephi, he that kept this last
      record, (and he kept it upon the plates of Nephi) died, and his son Amos kept it in his stead;
      and he kept it upon the plates of Nephi also. And he kept it eighty and four years, and there
      was still peace in the land, save it were a small part of the people who had revolted from the
      church and taken upon them the name of Lamanites; therefore there began to be Lamanites again
      in the land. And it came to pass that Amos died also, (and it was an hundred and ninety and
      four years from the coming of Christ) and his son Amos kept the record in his stead; and he
      also kept it upon the plates of Nephi; and it was also written in the book of Nephi, which is
      this book. And it came to pass that two hundred years had passed away; and the second
      generation had all passed away save it were a few. And now I, Mormon, would that ye should
      know that the people had multiplied, insomuch that they were spread upon all the face of the
      land, and that they had become exceedingly rich, because of their prosperity in Christ. And
      now, in this two hundred and first year there began to be among them those who were lifted up
      in pride, such as the wearing of costly apparel, and all manner of fine pearls, and of the
      fine things of the world. And from that time forth they did have their goods and their
      substance no more common among them. And they began to be divided into classes; and they began
      to build up churches, unto themselves to get gain, and began to deny the true church of
      Christ. And it came to pass that when two hundred and ten years had passed away there were
      many churches in the land; yea, there were many churches which professed to know the Christ,
      and yet they did deny the more parts of his gospel, insomuch that they did receive all manner
      of wickedness, and did administer that which was sacred unto him to whom it had been forbidden
      because of unworthiness. And this church did multiply exceedingly because of iniquity, and
      because of the power of Satan which did get hold upon their hearts. And again, there was
      another church which denied the Christ; and they did persecute the true church of Christ,
      because of their humility and their belief in Christ; and they did despise them because of the
      many miracles which were wrought among them. Therefore they did exercise power and authority
      over the disciples of Jesus which did tarry with them, and they did cast them into prison; but
      by the power of the word of God, which was in them, the prisons were rent in twain, and they
      went forth doing mighty miracles among them. Nevertheless, and notwithstanding all these
      miracles, the people did harden their hearts, and did seek to kill them, even as the Jews at
      Jerusalem sought to kill Jesus, according to his word. And they did cast them into furnaces of
      fire, and they came forth receiving no harm. And they also cast them into dens of wild beasts,
      and they did play with the wild beasts even as a child with a lamb; and they did come forth
      from among them, receiving no harm. Nevertheless, the people did harden their hearts, for they
      were led by many priests and false prophets to build up many churches, and to do all manner of
      iniquity. And they did smite upon the people of Jesus; but the people of Jesus did not smite
      again. And thus they did dwindle in unbelief and wickedness, from year to year, even until two
      hundred and thirty years had passed away. And now it came to pass in this year, yea, in the
      two hundred and thirty and first year, there was a great division among the people. And it
      came to pass that in this year there arose a people which was called the Nephites, and they
      were true believers in Christ; and among them there were they which was called by the
      Lamanites-Jacobites, and Josephites, and Zoramites; Therefore the true believers in Christ,
      and the true worshipers of Christ, (among whom were the three disciples of Jesus which should
      tarry) were called Nephites, and Jacobites, and Josephites, and Zoramites. And it came to pass
      that they which rejected the gospel were called Lamanites, and Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites;
      and they did not dwindle in unbelief, but they did willfully rebel against the gospel of
      Christ; and they did teach their children that they should not believe, even as their fathers,
      from the beginning, did dwindle. And it was because of the wickedness and abomination of their
      fathers, even as it was in the beginning. And they were taught to hate the children of God,
      even as the Lamanites were taught to hate the children of Nephi from the beginning. And it
      came to pass that two hundred and forty and four years had passed away, and thus were the
      affairs of the people. And the more wicked part of the people did wax strong, and became
      exceedingly more numerous than were the people of God. And they did still continue to build up
      churches unto themselves, and adorn them with all manner of precious things. And thus did two
      hundred and fifty years pass away, and also two hundred and sixty years. And it came to pass
      that the wicked part of the people began again to build up the secret oaths and combinations
      of Gadianton. And also the people who were called the people of Nephi began to be proud in
      their hearts, because of their exceeding riches, and become vain, like unto their brethren,
      the Lamanites. 44 And from this time the disciples began to sorrow for the sins of the world.
      And it came to pass that when three hundred years had passed away, both the people of Nephi
      and the Lamanites had become exceedingly wicked, one like unto another. And it came to pass
      that the robbers of Gadianton did spread over all the face of the land; and there were none
      that were righteous save it were the disciples of Jesus. And gold and silver did they lay up
      in store in abundance, and did traffic in all manner of traffic. And it came to pass that
      after three hundred and five years had passed away, (and the people did still remain in
      wickedness) Amos died; and his brother, Ammaron, did keep the record in his stead. And it came
      to pass that when three hundred and twenty years had passed away, Ammaron, being constrained
      by the Holy Ghost, did hide up the records which were sacred-yea, even all the sacred records
      which had been handed down from generation to generation, which were sacred-even until the
      three hundred and twentieth year from the coming of Christ. 49 And he did hide them up unto
      the Lord, that they might come again unto the remnant of the house of Jacob, according to the
      prophecies and the promises of the Lord. And thus is the end of the record of Ammaron. </text>

    <text> And now I, Mormon, make a record of the things which I have both seen and heard, and call
      it the Book of Mormon. --And about the time that Ammaron hid up the records unto the Lord, he
      came unto me, (I being about ten years of age; and I began to be learned somewhat after the
      manner of the learning of my people, ) And Ammaron saith unto me, I perceive that thou art a
      sober child, and art quick to observe; therefore when ye are about twenty and four years old,
      I would that ye should remember the things that ye have observed concerning this people; and
      when ye are of that age, go to the land of Antum, unto a hill, which is called Shim; and there
      have I deposited unto the Lord, all the sacred engravings concerning this people. And behold,
      ye shall take the plates of Nephi unto yourself, and the remainder shall ye leave in the place
      where they are; and ye shall engrave upon the plates of Nephi, all the things which ye have
      observed concerning this people. And I, Mormon, being a descendant of Nephi, (and my father's
      name was Mormon,) I remembered the things which Ammaron commanded me. And it came to pass that
      I being eleven years old, was carried by my father into the land southward, even to the land
      of Zarahemla: the whole face of the land having become covered with buildings, and the people
      were as numerous almost, as it were the sand of the sea. And it came to pass in this year
      there began to be a war between the Nephites, which consisted of the Nephites, and the
      Jacobites, and the Josephites, and the Zoramites: and this war was between the Nephites and
      the Lamanites, and the Lamanites and the Lemuelites, and the Ishmaelites. Now the Lamanites,
      and the Lemuelites, and the Ishmaelites, were called Lamanites, and the two parties were
      Nephites and Lamanites. And it came to pass that the war began to be among them, in the
      borders of Zarahemla, by the waters of Sidon. And it came to pass that the Nephites had
      gathered together a great number of men, even to exceed the number of thirty thousand. And it
      came to pass that they did have in this same year a number of battles, in the which the
      Nephites did beat the Lamanites, and did slay many of them. And it came to pass that the
      Lamanites withdrew their design, and there was peace settled in the land, and peace did remain
      for the space of about four years, that there were no blood shed. But wickedness did prevail
      upon the face of the whole land, insomuch that the Lord did take away his beloved disciples,
      and the work of miracles and of healing did cease, because of the iniquity of the people. And
      there were no gifts from the Lord, and the Holy Ghost did not come upon any, because of their
      wickedness and unbelief. And I, being fifteen years of age, and being somewhat of a sober
      mind, therefore I was visited of the Lord, and tasted , and knew of the goodness of Jesus. And
      I did endeavor to preach unto this people, but my mouth was shut, and I were forbidden that I
      should preach unto them: for behold they had wilfully rebelled against their God, and the
      beloved disciples were taken away out of the land, because of their iniquity. But I did remain
      among them, but I were forbidden that I should preach unto them, because of the hardness of
      their hearts; and because of the hardness of their hearts, the land was cursed for their sake.
      And these Gaddianton robbers, which were among the Lamanites, did infest the land, insomuch
      that the inhabitants thereof began to hide up their treasures in the earth; and they became
      slippery, because the Lord had cursed the land, that they could not hold them, nor retain them
      again. And it came to pass that there were sorceries, and witchcrafts, and magics: and the
      power of the evil one was wrought upon all the face of the land, even unto the fulfilling of
      all the words of Abinadi, and also Samuel the Lamanite. </text>

    <text> --And it came to pass in that same year, there began to be a war again between the
      Nephites and the Lamanites. And notwithstanding I being young, was large in stature, therefore
      the people of Nephi appointed me that I should be their leader, or the leader of their armies.
      Therefore it came to pass that in my sixteenth year, I did go forth at the head of an army of
      the Nephites, against the Lamanites; therefore three hundred and twenty and six years had
      passed away. And it came to pass that in the three hundred and twenty and seventh year, the
      Lamanites did come upon us with exceeding great power, insomuch that they did frighten my
      armies; therefore they would not fight, and they began to retreat towards the north countries.
      And it came to pass that we did come to the city of Angelah, and we did take possession of the
      city, and make preparations to defend ourselves against the Lamanites. And it came to pass
      that we did fortify the city with our mights; but notwithstanding all our fortifications, the
      Lamanites did come upon us, and did drive us out of the city. And they did also drive us forth
      out of the land of David. And we marched forth, and came to the land of Joshua, which was in
      the border west by the seashore. And it came to pass that we did gather our people as fast as
      it were possible, that we might get them together in one body. But behold, the land was filled
      with robbers and with Lamanites; and notwithstanding the great destruction which hung over my
      people, they did not repent of their evil doings; therefore there was blood and carnage spread
      throughout all the face of the land, both on the part of the Nephites, and also on the part of
      the Lamanites; and it was one complete revolution throughout all the face of the land. And now
      the Lamanites had a king, and his name was Aaron; and he came against us with an army of forty
      and four thousand. And behold, I withstood him, with forty and two thousand. And it came to
      pass that I beat him with my army, that he fled before me. And behold, all this was done, and
      three hundred and thirty years had passed away. And it came to pass that the Nephites began to
      repent of their iniquity, and began to cry even as had been prophesied by Samuel the prophet:
      for behold no man could keep that which was his own, for the thieves, and the robbers, and the
      murderers, and the magic art, and the witchcraft which was in the land. Thus there began to be
      mourning and lamentation in all the land, because of these things; and more especially among
      the people of Nephi. And it came to pass that when I, Mormon, saw their lamentation, and their
      mourning, and their sorrowing before the Lord, my heart did begin to rejoice within me:
      knowing the mercies and the long suffering of the Lord, therefore supposing that he would be
      merciful unto them, that they would again become a righteous people. But behold this my joy
      was in vain, for their sorrowing was not unto repentance, because of the goodness of God, but
      it was rather the sorrowing of the damned, because the Lord would not always suffer them to
      take happiness in sin. And they did not come unto Jesus with broken hearts and contrite
      spirits, but they did curse God, and wish to die. Nevertheless they would struggle with the
      sword for their lives. And it came to pass that my sorrow did return unto me again, and I saw
      that the day of grace was past with them, both temporally and spiritually: for I saw thousands
      of them hewn down in open rebellion against their God, and heaped up as dung upon the face of
      the land. And thus three hundred and forty and four years had passed away. And it came to pass
      that in the three hundred and forty and fifth year, the Nephites did begin to flee before the
      Lamanites, and they were pursued until they came even to the land of Jashon, before it were
      possible to stop them in their retreat. And now the city of Jashon was near the land where
      Ammaron had deposited the records unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed. And behold
      I had gone according to the word of Ammaron, and taken the plates of Nephi, and did make a
      record according to the words of Ammaron. And upon the plates of Nephi, I did make a full
      account of all the wickedness and abominations; but upon these plates I did forbear to make a
      full account of their wickedness and abominations: for behold, a continual scene of wickedness
      and abominations has been before mine eyes ever since I have been sufficient to behold the
      ways of man. And wo is me, because of their wickedness: for my heart has been filled with
      sorrow because of their wickedness, all my days; nevertheless, I know that I shall be lifted
      up at the last day. And it came to pass that in this year the people of Nephi again were
      hunted and driven. And it came to pass that we were driven forth until we had come northward
      to the land which was called Shem. And it came to pass that we did fortify the city of Shem,
      and we did gather in our people in as much as it were possible, that perhaps we might save
      them from destruction. And it came to pass in the three hundred and forty and sixth year, they
      began to come upon us again. And it came to pass that I did speak unto my people, and did urge
      them with great energy, that they would stand boldly before the Lamanites, and fight for their
      wives, and their children, and their houses and their homes. And my words did arouse them
      somewhat to vigor, insomuch that they did not flee from before the Lamanites, but did stand
      with boldness against them. And it came to pass that we did contend with an army of thirty
      thousand, against an army of fifty thousand. And it came to pass that we did stand before them
      with such firmness, that they did flee from before us. And it came to pass that when they had
      fled, we did pursue them with our armies, and did meet them again, and did beat them;
      nevertheless the strength of the Lord was not with us: yea, we were left to ourselves, that
      the spirit of the Lord did not abide in us; therefore we had become weak, like unto our
      brethren. And my heart did sorrow because of this great calamity of my people; because of
      their wickedness and their abominations. But behold we did go forth against the Lamanites, and
      the robbers of Gaddianton, until we had again taken possession of the lands of our
      inheritance. And the three hundred and forty and ninth year had passed away. And in three
      hundred and fiftieth year, we made a treaty with the Lamanites and the robbers of Gaddianton,
      in which we did get the lands of our inheritance divided. And the Lamanites did give unto us
      the land northward; yea, even to the narrow passage which led into the land southward. And we
      did give unto the Lamanites all the land southward. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that the Lamanites did not come to battle again until ten years more
      had passed away. And behold, I had employed my people, the Nephites, in preparing their lands
      and their arms against the time of battle. And it came to pass that the Lord did say unto me,
      Cry unto this people repent ye, and come unto me and be baptized, and build up again my
      church, and ye shall be spared. And I did cry unto this people, but it was in vain, and they
      did not realise that it was the Lord that had spared them, and granted unto them a chance for
      repentance. And behold, they did harden their hearts against the Lord their God. And it came
      to pass that after the tenth year had passed away, making in the whole, three hundred and
      sixty years from the coming of Christ, the king of the Lamanites sent an epistle unto me,
      which gave unto me to know that they were preparing to come again to battle against us. And it
      came to pass that they should gather themselves together at the land Desolation, to a city
      which was in the borders, by the narrow pass which lead into the land southward. And there we
      did place our armies, that we might stop the armies of the Lamanites, that they might not get
      possession of any of our lands; therefore we did fortify against them with all our force. And
      it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty and first year, the Lamanites did come
      down to the city of Desolation to battle, against us. And it came to pass that in that year,
      we did beat them, insomuch that they did return to their own lands again. And in the three
      hundred and sixty and second year, they did come down again to battle. And we did beat them
      again, and did slay a great number of them, and their dead was cast into the sea. And now
      because of this great thing which my people, the Nephites, had done, they began to boast in
      their own strength, and began to swear before the heavens that they would avenge themselves of
      the blood of their brethren which had been slain by their enemies. And they did swear by the
      heavens, and also by the throne of God, that they would go up to battle against their enemies,
      and would cut them off from the face of the land. And it came to pass that I, Mormon, did
      utterly refuse from this time forth, to be a commander and a leader of this people, because of
      their wickedness and abomination. Behold, I had led them, notwithstanding their wickedness, I
      had lead them many times to battle, and had loved them, according to the love of God which was
      in me, with all my heart; and my soul had been poured out in prayer unto my God all the day
      long, for them; nevertheless it was without faith, because of the hardness of their hearts.
      And thrice have I delivered them out of the hands of their enemies, and they have repented of
      their sins. And when they had sworn by all that had been forbidden them, by our Lord and
      Saviour Jesus Christ, that they would go up unto their enemies to battle, and avenge
      themselves of the blood of their brethren, behold, the voice of the Lord came unto me saying:
      Vengeance is mine, and I will repay; and because this people repented not after that I had
      delivered them, behold, they shall be cut off from the face of the earth. And it came to pass
      that I utterly refused to go up against mine enemies; and I did even as the Lord had commanded
      me; and I did stand as an idle witness to manifest unto the world the things which I saw and
      heard, according to the manifestations of the spirit which had testified of things to come.
      Therefore I write unto you, Gentiles, and also unto you, house of Israel, when the work shall
      commence that ye shall be about to prepare to return to the land of your inheritance; yea,
      behold, I write unto all the ends of the earth; yea, unto you, twelve tribes of Israel. which
      shall be judged according to your works, by the twelve whom Jesus chose to be his disciples in
      the land of Jerusalem. And I write also unto the remnant of this people, which shall also be
      judged by the other twelve whom Jesus chose in the land of Jerusalem. And these things do the
      spirit manifest unto me; therefore I write unto you all. And for this cause I write unto you,
      that ye may know that ye must all stand before the judgment seat of Christ, yea, every soul
      which belong to the whole human family of Adam; and ye must stand to be judged of your works,
      whether they be good or evil; and also that ye may believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which
      ye shall have among you; and also that the Jews, the covenant people of the Lord, shall have
      other witness besides that which they saw and heard, that Jesus, whom they slew, was the very
      Christ, and the very God; and I would that I could persuade all ye ends of the earth to repent
      and prepare to stand before the judgment seat of Christ. </text>

    <text> And now it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty and third year, the Nephites
      did go up with their armies to battle against the Lamanites, out of the land Desolation. And
      it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites were driven back again to the land of
      Desolation. And while they were yet weary, a fresh army of the Lamanites did come upon them;
      and they had a sore battle, insomuch that the Lamanites did take possession of the city
      Desolation, and did slay many of the Nephites, and did take many prisoners; and the remainder
      did flee and join the inhabitants of the city Teancum. Now the city Teancum lay in the borders
      by the seashore; and it was also near the city Desolation. And it was because of the Nephites
      went up unto the Lamanites, that they began to be smitten: for were it not for that, the
      Lamanites could have no power over them. But behold, the judgments of God will overtake the
      wicked; and it is by the wicked, that the wicked are punished: for it is the wicked that
      stireth up the hearts of the children of men unto bloodshed. --And it came to pass that the
      Lamanites did make preparation to come against the city Teancum. And it came to pass in the
      three hundred and sixty and fourth year, the Lamanites did come against the city Teancum, that
      they might take possession of the city Teancum also. And it came to pass that they were
      repulsed and driven back by the Nephites. And when the Nephites saw that they had driven the
      Lamanites, they did again boast of their strength; and they went forth in their own might, and
      took possession again of the city Desolation. And now all these things had been done and there
      had been thousands slain on both sides, both the Nephites and the Lamanites. And it came to
      pass that the three hundred and sixty and sixth year had passed away, and the Lamanites came
      again upon the Nephites to battle; and yet the Nephites repented not of the evil which they
      had done, but persisted in their wickedness continually. And it is impossible for the tongue
      to describe, or for a man to write a perfect description of the horrible scene of the blood
      and a carnage which was among the people, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites; and every
      heart was hardened, so that they delighted in shedding of blood continually. And there never
      had been so great wickedness among all the children of Lehi, nor even among all the house of
      Israel, according to the words of the Lord, as were among this people. And it came to pass
      that the Lamanites did take possession of the city Desolation, and this because their number
      did exceed the number of the Nephites. And they did also march forward against the city
      Teancum, and did drive the inhabitants forth out of her, and did take many prisoners of women
      and of children, and did offer them up as sacrifices unto their idol gods. And it came to pass
      that in the three hundred and sixty and seventh year, the Nephites being angry because the
      Lamanites had sacrificed their women and their children, that they did go against the
      Lamanites with exceeding anger, insomuch that they did beat again the Lamanites, and drive
      them out of their lands; and the Lamanites did not come again against the Nephites, until the
      three hundred and seventy and fifth year. And in this year they did come down against the
      Nephites with all their powers; and they were not numbered, because of the greatness of their
      number. And from this time forth did the Nephites gain no power over the Lamanites, but began
      to be swept off by them even as a dew before the sun. And it came to pass that the Lamanites
      did come down against the city of Desolation; and there was an exceeding sore battle fought in
      the land Desolation, in which they did beat the Nephites. And they fled again from before
      them, and they came to the city Beaz; and there they did stand against the Lamanites with
      exceeding boldness, insomuch that the Lamanites did not beat them until they had come again
      the second time. the Nephites were driven and slaughtered with an exceeding great slaughter;
      their women and their children were again sacrificed unto idols. And it came to pass that the
      Nephites did again flee from before them, taking all the inhabitants with them, both in towns
      and villages. And now I, Mormon, seeing that the Lamanites were about to overthrow the land,
      therefore I did go to the hill Shim, and did take all the records which Ammaron had hid up
      unto the Lord. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that I did go forth among the Nephites, and did repent of the oath
      which I made, That I would no more assist them; and they gave me command again of their
      armies: for they looked upon me as though I could deliver them from their afflictions. But
      behold, I was without hopes, for I knew the judgments of the Lord which should come upon them:
      for they repented not of their iniquities, but did struggle for their lives, without calling
      upon that Being who had created them. And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come against
      us as we fled to the city of Jordan; but behold, they were driven back that they did not take
      the city at that time. And it came to pass that they came against us again, and we did
      maintain the city. And there were also other cities which were maintained by the Nephites,
      which strong holds did cut them off that they could not get into the country which lay before
      us to destroy the inhabitants of our land. But it came to pass that whatsoever lands we had
      passed by, and the inhabitants thereof were not gathered in, were destroyed by the Lamanites,
      and their towns, and villages, and cities were burned with fire; and thus the three hundred
      and seventy and nine years passed away. And it came to pass that in the three hundred and
      eightieth year, the Lamanites did come again against us to battle, and we did stand against
      them boldly; but it was all in vain, for so great were their numbers that they did tread the
      people of the Nephites under their feet. And it came to pass that we did again take to flight,
      and they whose flight were swifter than the Lamanites did escape, and they whose flight did
      not exceed the Lamanites, were swept down and destroyed. And now behold, I, Mormon, do not
      desire to harrow up the souls of men in casting before them such an awful scene of blood and
      carnage as was laid before mine eyes, but I, knowing that these things must surely be made
      known, and that all things which are hid must be revealed upon the house tops, and also that a
      knowledge of these things must come unto the remnant of these people, and also unto the
      Gentiles, which the Lord hath said should scatter this people, and this people should be
      counted as nought among them, therefore I write a small abridgement, daring not to give a full
      account of the things which I have seen, because of the commandment which I have received, and
      also that ye might not have too great sorrow because of the wickedness of this people. And now
      behold, this I speak unto their seed, and also to the Gentiles, which hath care for the house
      of Israel, that realize and know from whence their blessings come: For I know that such will
      sorrow for the calamity of the house of Israel; yea, they will sorrow for the destruction of
      this people; they will sorrow that this people had not repented, that they might have been
      clasped in the arms of Jesus. Now these things are written unto the remnant of the house of
      Jacob; and they are written after the manner, because it is known of God that wickedness will
      not bring them forth unto them; and they are to be hid up unto the Lord, that they may come
      forth in his own due time. And this is the commandment which I have received; and behold they
      shall come forth according to the commandment of the Lord, when he shall see fit, in his
      wisdom. And behold they shall go unto the unbelieving of the Jews; and for this intent shall
      they go: that they may be persuaded that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God; that
      the Father may bring about, through his most beloved, his great and eternal purpose, in the
      restoring the Jews or all the house of Israel, to the land of their inheritance, which the
      Lord their God hath given them, unto the fulfilling of his covenant, and also that the seed of
      this people may more fully believe his gospel, which shall go forth unto them from the
      Gentiles: for this people shall be scattered, and shall become a dark, a filthy, and loathsome
      people beyond the description of that which ever hath been amongst us; yea, even that which
      hath been among the Lamanites; and this because of their unbelief and idolatry: For behold,
      the spirit of the Lord hath already ceased to strive with their fathers, and they are without
      Christ and God in the world, and they are driven about as chaff before the wind. They were
      once a delightsome people, and they had Christ for their Shepherd; yea, they were led even by
      God the Father. But now, behold they are led about by Satan, even as chaff is driven before
      the wind, or as a vessel is tossed about upon the waves, without sail or anchor, or without
      any thing wherewith to steer her; and even as she is, so are they. And behold, the Lord hath
      reserved their blessing, which they might have received in the land, for the Gentiles, which
      shall possess the land. --But behold, it shall come to pass that they shall be driven and
      scattered by the Gentiles; and after that they have been driven and scattered by the Gentiles,
      behold, then will the Lord remember the covenant which he made unto Abraham, and unto all the
      house of Israel. And also the Lord will remember the prayers of the righteous, which hath been
      put up unto him for them. And then, O ye Gentiles, how can ye stand before the power of God,
      except ye shall repent and turn from your evil ways? Know ye not that ye are in the hands of
      God? Know ye not that he hath all power, and at his great command the earth shall be rolled
      together as a scroll? Therefore repent ye, and humble yourselves before him, lest he shall
      come out in justice against you; lest a remnant of the seed of Jacob shall go forth among you
      as a lion, and tear you in pieces, and there is none to deliver. </text>

    <text> And now I finish my record concerning the destruction of my people, the Nephites. And it
      came to pass that we did march forth before the Lamanites. And I, Mormon, wrote an epistle
      unto the king of the Lamanites, and desired of him that he would grant unto us that we might
      gather together our people unto the land of Camorah, by the hill which was called Camorah, and
      there we would give them battle. And it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites did grant
      unto me the thing which I desired. And it came to pass that we did march forth to the land of
      Camorah; and we did pitch our tents round about the hill of Camorah; and it was in a land of
      many waters, rivers and fountains; and here we had hope to gain advantage over the Lamanites.
      And when three hundred and eighty and four years had passed away, we had gathered in all the
      remainder of our people unto the land Camorah. And it came to pass that when we had gathered
      in all our people in one to the land of Camorah, behold I, Mormon, began to be old; knowing it
      to be the last struggle of my people, and having been commanded of the Lord that I should not
      suffer that the records which had been handed down by our fathers, which were sacred, to fall
      into the hands of the Lamanites, (for the Lamanites would destroy them,) therefore I made this
      record out of the plates of Nephi, and hid up in the hill of Camorah, all the records which
      had been entrusted to me by the hand of the Lord, save it were these few plates which I gave
      unto my son Moroni. And it came to pass that my people, with their wives and their children,
      did now behold the armies of the Lamanites a marching towards them; and with that awful fear
      of death which fills the breasts of all the wicked, did they await to receive them. And it
      came to pass that they came to battle against us, and every soul was filled with terror,
      because of the greatness of their numbers. And it came to pass that they did fall upon my
      people with the sword, and with the bow, and with the arrow, and with the axe, and with all
      manner of weapons of war. And it came to pass that my men were hewn down, yea, even my ten
      thousand which were with me, and I fell wounded in the midst; and they passed by me that they
      did not put an end to my life. And when they had gone through and hewn down all my people save
      it were twenty and four of us, (among whom was my son Moroni,) and we having survived the dead
      of our people, did behold on the morrow, when the Lamanites had returned unto their camps,
      from the top of the hill Camorah, the ten thousand of my people which were hewn down, being
      led in front by me, and we also beheld the ten thousand of my people which were led by my son
      Moroni. And behold, the ten thousand of Gidgiddonah had fallen, and he also in the midst; and
      Lamah had fallen with his ten thousand; and Gilgal had fallen with his ten thousand; and
      Limhah had fallen with his ten thousand; and Joneam had fallen with his ten thousand; and
      Camenihah and Moronihah, and Antionum, and Shiblom, and Shem, and Josh, had fallen with their
      ten thousand each. And it came to pass that there were ten more which did fall by the sword,
      with their ten thousand each; yea, even all my people, save it were those twenty and four
      which were with me, and also a few which had escaped into the south countries, and a few which
      had dissented over unto the Lamanites, had fallen, and their flesh, and bones, and blood lay
      upon the face of the earth, being left by the hands of those who slew them, to moulder upon
      the land, and to crumble and to return to their mother earth. And my soul was rent with
      anguish, because of the slain of my people: And I cried, O ye fair ones, how could ye have
      departed from the ways of the Lord! O ye fair ones, how could ye have rejected that Jesus, who
      stood with open arms to receive you! Behold, if ye had not done this, ye would not have
      fallen. But behold, ye are fallen, and I mourn your loss. O ye fair sons and daughters, ye
      fathers and mothers, ye husbands and wives, ye fair ones, how is it that ye could have fallen!
      But behold, ye are gone, and my sorrows cannot bring your return; and the day soon cometh that
      your mortal must put on immortality, and these bodies which are now mouldering in corruption,
      must soon become incorruptible bodies; and then ye must stand before the judgment seat of
      Christ, to be judged according to your works: and if it so be that ye are righteous, then ye
      are blessed with your fathers which have gone before you. O that ye had repented before that
      this great destruction had come upon you. But behold, ye are gone, and the Father, yea, the
      eternal Father of heaven, knoweth your state; and he doeth with you according to his justice
      and mercy. </text>

    <text> And now behold, I would speak somewhat unto the remnant of this people which are spared,
      if it so be that God may give unto them my words, that they may know of the things of their
      fathers; yea, I speak unto you, ye remnant of the house of Israel; and this is the words which
      I speak: Know ye that ye are of the house of Israel. Know ye that ye must come unto
      repentance, or ye cannot be saved. Know ye that ye must lay down your weapons of war, and
      delight no more in the shedding of blood, and take them not again, save it be that God shall
      command you. Know ye that ye must come to the knowledge of your fathers, and repent of all of
      your sins and iniquities, and believe in Jesus Christ, that he is the Son of God, and that he
      was slain by the Jews, and by the power of the Father he hath risen again, whereby he hath
      gained the victory over the grave; and also in him is the sting of death swallowed up. And he
      bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead, whereby man must be raised to stand before his
      judgment seat. And he hath brought to pass the redemption of the world, whereby he that is
      found guiltless before him at the judgment day, hath it given unto them to dwell in the
      presence of God in his kingdom, to sing ceaseless praises with the choirs above, unto the
      Father, and unto the Son, and unto the Holy Ghost, which is one God, in a state of happiness
      which hath no end. Therefore repent, and be baptized in the name of Jesus, and lay hold upon
      the Gospel of Christ, which shall be set before you, not only in this record, but also in the
      record which shall come unto the Gentiles from the Jews, which record shall come from the
      Gentiles unto you. For behold, this is written for the intent that ye may believe that; and if
      ye believe that, ye will believe this also; and if ye believe this, ye will know concerning
      your fathers, and also the marvellous works which were wrought by the power of God among them;
      and ye will also know that ye are a remnant of the seed of Jacob; therefore ye are numbered
      among the people of the first covenant; and if it so be that ye believe in Christ, and are
      baptized, first with water, then with fire and with the Holy Ghost, following the example of
      our Saviour according to that which he hath commanded us, it shall be well with you in the day
      of judgment. Amen. </text>

    <text> Behold I, Moroni, do finish the record of my father Mormon. Behold, I have but a few
      things to write, which things I have been commanded of my father. And now it came to pass that
      after the great and tremendous battle at Camorah, behold, the Nephites which had escaped into
      the country southward, were hunted by the Lamanites, until they were all destroyed; and my
      father was also killed by them; and I, even I remaineth alone to write the sad tale of the
      destruction of my people. But behold, they are gone, and I fulfil the commandment of my
      father. And whether they will slay me, I know not; therefore I will write and hide up the
      records in the earth: and whither I go it mattereth not. Behold, my father hath made this
      record, and he hath written the intent thereof. And behold, I would write it also. if I had
      room upon the plates; but I have not; and ore I have none, for I am alone: my father hath been
      slain in battle, and all my kinsfolk, and I have not friends nor whither to go; and how long
      that the Lord will suffer that I may live, I know not. Behold, four hundred years have passed
      away since the coming of our Lord and Saviour. And behold, the Lamanites have hunted my
      people, the Nephites, down from city to city, and from place to place, even until they are no
      more; and great has been their fall; yea, great and marvellous is the destruction of my
      people, the Nephites. and behold, it is the hand of the Lord which hath done it. And behold
      also, the Lamanites are at war one with another; and the whole face of this land is one
      continual round of murder and bloodshed; and no one knoweth the end of the war. And now
      behold, I say no more concerning them, for there are none, save it be Lamanites and robbers,
      that do exist upon the face of the land; and there are none that do know the true God, save it
      be the disciples of Jesus, which did tarry in the land until the wickedness of the people were
      so great, that the Lord would not suffer them to remain with the people; and whether they be
      upon the face of the land, no man knoweth. But behold, my father and I have seen them, and
      they have ministered unto us. And whoso receiveth this record and shall not condemn it because
      of the imperfections which are in it, the same shall know of greater things than these.
      Behold, I am Moroni; and were it possible, I would make all things known unto you. Behold, I
      make an end of speaking concerning this people. I am the son of Mormon, and my father was a
      descendant of Nephi; and I am the same which hideth up this record unto the Lord; the plates
      thereof are of no worth, because of the commandment of the Lord. For he truly saith, That no
      one shall have them to get gain; but the record thereof is of great worth; and whoso shall
      bring it to light, him will the Lord bless. For none can have power to bring it to light, save
      it be given him of God: for God will that it shall be done with and eye singled to his glory,
      or the welfare of the ancient and long dispersed covenant people of the Lord. And blessed be
      him that shall bring this thing to light: for it shall be brought out of darkness unto light,
      according to the word of God; yea, it shall be brought out of the earth, and it shall shine
      forth out of darkness, and come unto the knowledge of the people; and it shall be done by the
      power of God: and if there be faults, they be the faults of a man. But behold, we know no
      fault. Nevertheless, God knoweth all things; therefore he that condemneth, let him be aware
      lest he shall be in danger of hell fire. And he that sayeth, Shew unto me, or ye shall be
      smitten, let him beware lest he commandeth that which is forbidden of the Lord. For behold,
      the same that judgeth rashly, shall be judged rashly again: for according to his works shall
      his wages be; therefore, he that smiteth, shall be smitten again of the Lord. Behold what the
      Scriptures saith: Man shall not smite, neither shall he judge: for judgment is mine, saith the
      Lord; and vengeance is mine also, and I will repay. And he that shall breathe out wrath and
      strifes against the work of the Lord, and against the covenant people of the Lord, which is
      the house of Israel, and shall say, We will destroy the work of the Lord, and the Lord will
      not remember his covenant which he hath made unto the house of Israel, the same is in danger
      to be hewn down and cast into the fire: for the eternal purposes of the Lord shall roll on,
      until all his promises shall be fulfilled. Search the prophecies of Isaiah. Behold, I cannot
      write them. Yea, behold I say unto you, That those saints which have gone before me, which
      have possessed this land, shall cry; yea, even from the dust will they cry unto the Lord; and
      the Lord liveth, he will remember the covenant which he hath made with them. And he knoweth
      their prayers, that they were in the behalf of their brethren. And he knoweth their faith: for
      in his name could they remove mountains; and in his name could they cause the earth to shake;
      and by the power of his word did they cause prisons to tumble to the earth; yea, even the
      fiery furnace could not harm them; neither wild beasts, nor poisonous serpents, because of the
      power of his word. And behold, their prayers were also in behalf of him that the Lord should
      suffer to bring these things forth. And no one need not say, They shall not come, for they
      surely shall, for the Lord hath spoken it: for out of the earth shall they come, by the hand
      of the Lord, and none can stay it; and it shall come in a day when it shall be said that
      miracles are done away; and it shall come even as if one should speak from the dead. And it
      shall come in a day when the blood of saints shall cry unto the Lord, because of secret
      combinations and the works of darkness; yea, it shall come in a day when the power of God
      shall be denied, and churches become defiled, and shall be lifted up in the pride of their
      hearts; yea, even in a day when leaders of churches, and teachers, in the pride of their
      hearts, even to the envying of them who belong to their churches; yea, it shall come in a day
      when there shall be heard of fires, and tempests, and vapors of smoke in foreign lands; and
      there shall also be heard of wars, and rumors of wars, and earthquakes in diverse places; yea,
      it shall come in a day when there shall be great pollutions upon the face of the earth: there
      shall be murders, and robbing, and lying, and deceivings, and whoredoms, and all manner of
      abominations; when there shall be many which will say, Do this, or do that, and it mattereth
      not, for the Lord will uphold such at the last day. But wo unto such, for they are in the gall
      of bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity. Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be
      churches built up that shall say, Come unto me, and for your money you shall be forgiven of
      your sins. O ye wicked and perverse, and stiffnecked people, why have ye built up churches
      unto yourselves to get gain? Why have ye transfigured the holy word of God, that ye might
      bring damnation upon your souls? Behold, look ye unto the revelations of God. For behold, the
      time cometh at that day when all these things must be fulfilled. Behold, the Lord hath shewn
      unto me great and marvellous things concerning that which must shortly come at that day when
      these things shall come forth among you. Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and
      yet ye are not. But behold, Jesus Christ hath shewn you unto me, and I know your doings; and I
      know that ye do walk in the pride of your hearts; and there are none, save a few only, which
      do not lift themselves up in the pride of their hearts, unto the wearing of very fine apparel,
      unto envyings, and strifes, and malice, and persecutions, and all manner of iniquities; and
      your churches, yea, even every one, have become polluted because of the pride of your hearts.
      For behold, ye do love money, and your substances, and your fine apparel, and the adorning of
      your churches, more than ye love the poor and the needy, the sick and afflicted. O ye
      pollutions, ye hypocrites, ye teachers, which sell yourselves for that which will canker, why
      have ye polluted the holy church of God? Why are ye ashamed to take upon you the name of
      Christ? Why do ye not think that greater is the value of an endless happiness, than that
      misery which never dies, because of the praise of the world? Why do ye adorn yourselves with
      that which hath no life, and yet suffer the hungry, and the needy, and the naked, and the
      sick, and the afflicted to pass by you, and notice them not? Yea, why do ye build up your
      secret abominations to get gain, and cause that widows should mourn before the Lord, and also
      orphans to mourn before the Lord; and also the blood of their fathers and their husbands to
      cry unto the Lord from the ground, for vengeance upon your heads? Behold, the sword of
      vengeance hangeth over you; and the time cometh that he avengeth the blood of the saints upon
      you, for he will not suffer their cries any longer. </text>

    <text> And now, I speak also concerning those who do not believe in Christ. Behold, will ye
      believe in the day of your visitation, behold, when the Lord shall come; yea, even that great
      day when the earth shall be rolled together as a scroll, and the elements shall melt with
      fervent heat; yea, in that great day when ye shall be brought to stand before the Lamb of God,
      then will ye say that there is no God? Then will ye longer deny the Christ, or can ye behold
      the Lamb of God? Do ye suppose that ye shall dwell with him under a consciousness of your
      guilt? Do ye suppose that ye could be happy to dwell with that holy Being, when your souls are
      racked with a consciousness of your guilt that ye have ever abused his laws? Behold I say unto
      you, that ye would be more miserable to dwell with a holy and just God, under a consciousness
      of your filthiness before him, than ye would to dwell with the damned souls in hell? For
      behold, when ye shall be brought to see your nakedness before God, and also the glory of God,
      and the holiness of Jesus Christ, it will kindle a flame of unquenchable fire upon you. O then
      ye unbelieving, turn ye unto the Lord; cry mightily unto the Father in the name of Jesus, that
      perhaps ye may be found spotless, pure, fair, and white, having been cleansed by the blood of
      the Lamb, at that great and last day. And again I speak unto you, who deny the revelations of
      God, and say that they are done away, that there is no revelations, nor prophecies, and the
      interpretation of tongues. Behold I say unto you, He that denieth these things, knoweth not
      the Gospel of Christ; yea, they have not read the Scriptures; if so, they do not understand
      them. For do we not read that God is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever: and in him there
      is no variableness, neither shadow of changing. And now, if ye have imagined up unto
      yourselves a god which doth vary, and in him there is shadow of changing, then have ye
      imagined up unto yourselves a god which is not a God of miracles. But behold, I will shew unto
      you a God of miracles, even the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;
      and it is that same God which created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them
      is. Behold, he crated Adam; and by Adam came the fall of man. And because of the fall of man,
      came Jesus Christ, even the Father and the Son; and because of Jesus Christ, came the
      redemption of man. And because of the redemption of man, which came by Jesus Christ, they are
      brought back into the presence of the Lord; yea, this is wherein all men are redeemed, because
      the death of Christ bringeth to pass the resurrection, which bringeth to pass a redemption
      from an endless sleep, from which sleep all men shall be awoke by the power of God, when the
      trump shall sound; and they shall come forth, both small and great, and all shall stand before
      his bar, being redeemed and loosed from their eternal band of death, which death is a temporal
      death; and then cometh the judgment of the Holy One upon them; and then cometh the time that
      he that is filthy, shall be filthy still; and he that is righteous, shall be righteous still:
      he that is happy, shall be happy still; and he that is unhappy, shall be unhappy still. And
      now, O all ye that have imagined up unto yourselves a god which can do no miracles, I would
      ask of you, have all these things past, of which I have spoken? Has, the end come yet? Behold
      I say unto you, Nay; and God has not ceased to be a God of miracles. Behold, are not the
      things that God hath wrought, marvellous in our eyes? Yea, and who can comprehend the
      marvellous works of God? Who shall say that it was not a miracle, that by his word the heaven
      and the earth should be; and by the power of his word, man was created of the dust of the
      earth; and by the power of his word, hath miracles been wrought? And who shall say that Jesus
      Christ did not do many miracles? And there was many mighty miracles wrought by the hands of
      the apostles. And if there was miracles wrought, then why has God ceased to be God of
      miracles, and yet be an unchangeable being. And behold I say unto you, He changeth not: if so,
      he would cease to be God; and he ceaseth not to be God, and is a God of miracles. And the
      reason why he ceaseth to do miracles among the children of men, is because that they dwindle
      in unbelief, and depart from the right way, and know not the God in whom they should trust.
      Behold I say unto you, That whoso believeth in Christ, doubting nothing what so ever he shall
      ask the Father in the name of Christ, it shall be granted them: and this promise is unto all,
      even unto the ends of the earth. For behold, thus saith Jesus Christ, the Son of God, unto his
      disciples which should tarry; yea, and also to all his disciples, in the hearing of the
      multitude, Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature; and he that
      believeth and is baptized, shall be saved, but he that believeth not, shall be damned. And
      these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they cast out Devils; they shall
      speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it
      shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover; and whosoever
      shall believe in my name, doubting nothing, unto him will I confirm all my words, even unto
      the ends of the earth. And now behold, who can stand against the works of the Lord? Who can
      deny his sayings? Who will rise up against the almighty power of the Lord? Who will despise
      the works of the Lord? Who will despise the children of Christ? Behold, all ye that are
      despisers of the works of the Lord, for ye shall wonder and perish. O then despise not, and
      wonder not, but hearken unto the words of the Lord, and ask the Father in the name of Jesus
      for what things soever ye shall stand in need. Doubt not, but believing and begin as in times
      of old, and come unto the Lord with all your heart, and work out your own salvation with fear
      and trembling before him. Be wise in the days of your probation; strip yourselves of all
      uncleanness; ask not, that ye may consume it on your lusts, but ask with firmness unshaken,
      that ye will yield to no temptation, but that ye will serve the true and living God. See that
      ye are baptized unworthily; see that ye partake not of the sacrament of Christ unworthily; but
      see that ye do all things in worthiness, and do it in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the
      living God; and if ye do this, and endure to the end, ye will in no wise be cast out.--
      Behold, I speak unto you as though I spake from the dead: for I know that ye shall hear my
      words. Condemn me not because of mine imperfection; neither my father, because of his
      imperfection; neither them which have written before him, but rather give thanks unto God that
      he hath made manifest unto you our imperfections, that ye may learn to be more wise than that
      which we have been. And now behold, we have written this record according to our knowledge in
      the characters, which are called among us the reformed Egyptian being handed down and altered
      by us, according to our manner of speech. And if our plates had been sufficiently large, we
      should have written in Hebrew; but the Hebrew hath been altered by us also; and if we could
      have written in the Hebrew, behold, ye would have had none imperfection in our record. But the
      Lord knoweth the things which we have written, and also that none other people knoweth our
      language; and because that none other people knoweth our language, therefore he hath prepared
      means for the interpretation thereof. And these things are written, that ye may rid our
      garments of the blood of our brethren which have dwindled in unbelief. And behold, these
      things which we have desired concerning our brethren, yea, even their restoration to the
      knowledge of Christ, is according to the prayers of all the saints which have dwelt in the
      land. And may the Lord Jesus Christ grant that their prayers may be answered according to
      their faith; and may God the Father remember the covenant which he hath made with the house of
      Israel; and may he bless them forever, through faith on the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

    <text> And now I, Moroni, proceed to give an account of those ancient inhabitants which were
      destroyed by the hand of the Lord upon the face of this north country. And I take mine account
      from the twenty and four plates which were found by the people of Limhi, which is called the
      Book of Ether. And as I suppose that the first part of this record, which speaketh concerning
      the creation of the world, and also of Adam, an account from that time even to the great
      tower, and whatsoever things transpired among the children of men until that time, is had
      among the Jews, therefore I do not write those things which transpired from the days of Adam
      until that time; but they are had upon the plates; and whoso findeth them, the same will have
      power that he may get the full account. But behold, I give not the full account, but a part of
      the account I give, from the tower down until they were destroyed. And on this wise do I give
      the account. He that wrote this record was Ether, and he was a descendant of Coriantor;
      Coriantor was the son of Moron; and Moron was the son of Ethem; and Ethem was the son of Ahah;
      and Ahah was the son of Seth; and Seth was the son of Shiblon; and Shiblon was the son of Com;
      and Com was the son of Coriantum; and Coriantum was the son of Amnigaddah; and Amnigaddah was
      the son of Aaron; and Aaron was a descendant of Heth, who was the son of Hearthom; and
      Hearthom was the son of Lib; and Lib was the son of Kish; and Kish was the son of Corom; and
      Corom was the son of Levi; and Levi was the son of Kim; and Kim was the son of Morianton; and
      Morianton was a descendant of Riplakish; and Riplakish was the son of Shez; and Shez was the
      son of Heth; And Heth was the son of Com; and Com was the son of Coriantum; and Coriantum was
      the son of Emer; and Emer was the son of Omer; and Omer was the son of Shule; and Shule was
      the son of Kib; and Kib was the son of Orihah, which was the son of Jared; which Jared came
      forth with his brother and their families, with some others and their families, from the great
      tower, at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people, and swear in his wrath that
      they should be scattered upon all the face of the earth; and according to the word of the Lord
      the people were scattered. And the brother of Jared, being a large and a mighty man, and being
      a man highly favored of the Lord; for Jared his brother said unto him, Cry unto the Lord, that
      he will not confound us that we may not understand our words. And it came to pass that the
      brother of Jared did cry unto the Lord, and the Lord had compassion upon Jared; therefore he
      did not confound the language of Jared; and Jared and his brother were not confounded. Then
      Jared said unto his brother, Cry again unto the Lord, and it may be that he will turn away his
      anger from them which are our friends, that he confound not their language. And it came to
      pass that the brother of Jared did cry unto the Lord, and the Lord had compassion upon their
      friends, and their families also, that they were not confounded. And it came to pass that
      Jared spake again unto his brother, saying, Go and inquire of the Lord whether he will drive
      us out of the land; and if he will drive us out of the land, cry unto him whither we shall go.
      And who knoweth but the Lord will carry us forth into a land which is choice above all the
      earth. And if it so be, let us be faithful unto the Lord, that we may receive it for our
      inheritance. And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did cry unto the Lord according to
      that which had been spoken by the mouth of Jared. And it came to pass that the Lord did hear
      the brother Jared, and had compassion upon him, and said unto him, Go to and gather together
      thy flocks, both male and female, of every kind; and also of the seed of the earth of every
      kind, and thy families; and also Jared thy brother and his family; and also thy friends and
      their families, and the friend of Jared and their families. And when thou hast done this, thou
      shalt go at the head of them down into the valley, which is northward. And there will I meet
      thee, and I will go before thee into a land which is choice above all the land of the earth.
      And there will I bless thee and thy seed, and raise up unto me of thy seed, and the seed of
      thy brother, and they which shall go with thee, a great nation. And there shall be none
      greater than the nation which I will raise up unto me of thy seed, upon all the face of the
      earth. And thus I will do unto thee because of this long time which ye have cried unto me.

    <text> And it came to pass that Jared and his brother, and their families, and also the friends
      of Jared and his brother, and their families, went down into the valley which was northward,
      mighty hunter,) with their flocks which they had gathered together, male and female, of every
      kind. And they did also lay snares and catch the fowls of the air; and they did also prepare a
      vessel, in the which they did carry with them the fish of the waters; and they did also carry
      with them deseret, which by interpretation, is a honey bee; and thus they did carry with them
      swarms of bees, and all manner of that which was upon the face of the land, seeds of every
      kind. And it came to pass that when they did come down into the valley of Nimrod, the Lord
      came down and talked with the brother of Jared; and he was in a clowd, and the brother of
      Jared saw him not. And it came to pass that the Lord commanded them that they should go forth
      into the wilderness, yea, into that quarter where there never had man been. And it came to
      pass that the Lord did go before them, and did talk with them as he stood in a cloud, and gave
      directions, whither they should travel. --And it came to pass that they did travel in the
      wilderness, and did build barges, in the which they did cross many waters, being directed
      continually by the hand of the Lord. And the Lord would not suffer that they should stop
      beyond the sea in the wilderness, but he would that they should come forth even unto the land
      of promise, which was choice above all other lands, which the Lord God had preserved for a
      righteous people; and he had sworn in his wrath unto the brother of Jared, that whoso possess
      this land of promise, from that time henceforth and forever, should serve him, the true and
      only God, or they should be swept off when the fulness of his wrath should come upon them. And
      now we can behold the decrees of God concerning this land, that is a land of promise, and
      whatsoever nation shall possess it, shall serve God, or they shall be swept off when the
      fulness of his wrath shall come upon them. And the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when
      they are ripened in iniquity: for behold, this is a land which is choice above all other
      lands; wherefore he that doth possess it shall serve God, or shall be swept off; for it is the
      everlasting decrees of God. And it is not until the fulness of iniquity among the children of
      the land, that they are swept off. And this cometh unto you, O ye Gentiles, that ye may know
      the decrees of God, that ye may repent, and not continue in your iniquities until the fulness
      be come, that ye may not bring down the fulness of the wrath of God upon you, as the
      inhabitants of the land hitherto done. Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation
      shall possess it, shall be free from bondage, and captivity, and from all other nations under
      the Heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, which is Jesus Christ, which hath been
      manifested by the things which we have written. And now I proceed with my record: for behold
      it came to pass that the Lord did bring Jared and his brethren forth even to that great sea
      which divideth the lands. And as they came to the sea, they pitched their tents; and they
      called the name of the place Moriancumer; and they dwelt in tents; and dwelt in tents upon the
      seashore for the space of four years. And it came to pass at the end of the four years, that
      the Lord came again unto the brother of Jared, and stood in a cloud and talked to him. And for
      the space of three hours did the Lord talk with the brother of Jared, and chastened him
      because he remembered not to call upon the name of the Lord. And the brother of Jared repented
      him of the evil which he had done, and did call upon the name of the Lord for his brethern
      which were with him. And the Lord said unto him, I will forgive thee and thy brethren of their
      sins; but thou shalt not sin anymore, for ye shall remember that my spirit will not always
      strive with man; wherefore if ye will sin until ye are fully ripe, ye shall be cut off from
      the presence of the Lord. And this is my thoughts upon the land which I shall give you for
      your inheritance; for it shall be a land choice above all other lands. And the Lord said, Go
      to work and build, after the manner of barges which ye have hitherto built. And it came to
      pass that the brother of Jared did go to work, and also his brethren, and built barges after
      the manner which they had built, according to the instructions of the Lord. And they were
      small, and they were light upon the water; and they were built after a manner that they were
      exceeding tight; even that they would hold water like unto a dish; and the bottom thereof was
      tight like unto a dish; and the sides thereof was tight like unto a dish; and the ends thereof
      were peaked; and the top thereof was tight like unto a dish; and the length thereof was the
      length of a tree; and the door thereof, when it was shut, was tight like unto a dish. And it
      came to pass that the brother of Jared cried unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, I have performed
      the work which thou hast commanded me, and I have made the barges according as thou hast
      directed me. And behold, O Lord, in them there is no light, whither shall we steer. --And also
      we shall perish, for in them we cannot breathe, save it is the air which is in them; therefore
      we shall perish. And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared, Behold, thou shalt make a hole
      in the top thereof, and also in the bottom thereof; and when thou shalt suffer for air, thou
      shalt unstop the hole thereof, and receive air. And if it so be that the water come in upon
      thee, behold, ye shall stop the hole thereof, that ye may not perish in the flood. And it came
      to pass that the brother of Jared did so, according as the Lord commanded. And he cried again
      unto the Lord, saying, O Lord, behold I have done even as thou hast commanded me; and I have
      prepared the vessels for my people, and behold, there is no light in them. Behold, O Lord,
      wilt thou suffer that we shall cross this great water in darkness? And the Lord said unto the
      brother of Jared, What will ye that I should do that ye may have light in your vessels? For
      behold, ye cannot have windows, for they will be dashed in pieces; neither shall ye take fire
      with you, for ye shall not go by the light of the fire: for behold, ye shall be as a whale in
      the midst of the sea; for the mountain waves shall dash upon you. Nevertheless, I will bring
      you up again out of the depths of the sea: for the winds have gone out of my mouth, and also
      the rains and the floods have I sent forth. And behold, I prepare you against these things:
      for howbeit, ye cannot cross this great deep, save I prepare you against the waves of the sea,
      and the winds which have gone forth, and the floods which shall come. --Therefore what will ye
      that I should prepare for you, that ye may have light when ye are swallowed up in the depths
      of the sea? </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that the brother of Jared, (now the number of the vessels which had
      been prepared, was eight,) went forth unto the mount, which they called the mount Shelem,
      because of its exceeding height, and did moulten out of a rock sixteen small stones; and they
      were light and clear, even as transparent glass; and he did carry them in his hands upon the
      top of the mount, and cried again unto the Lord, saying, O Lord, thou hast said that we must
      be encompassed about by the floods. Now behold, O Lord, and do not be angry with they servant
      because of his weakness before thee: for we know that thou art holy, and dwellest in the
      heavens, and that we are unworthy before thee: because of the fall, of our natures have become
      evil continually; nevertheless, O Lord, thou hast given us a commandment that we must call
      upon thee, that from thee we may receive according to our desires. Behold, O Lord, thou hast
      smitten us because of our iniquity, and hath driven us forth, and for this many years we have
      been in the wilderness; nevertheless, thou hast been merciful unto us. O Lord, look upon me in
      pity, and turn away thine anger from this thy people, and suffer it not that they shall go
      forth across this raging deep in darkness, but behold these things which I have moulten out of
      the rock. --And I know, O Lord, that thou hast all power, and can do whatsoever thou wilt for
      the benefit of man; therefore touch these stones, O Lord, with thy finger, and prepare them
      that they may shine forth in darkness; and they shall shine forth unto us in the vessels which
      we have prepared, that we may have light while we cross the sea. Behold, O Lord, thou canst do
      this. We know that thou art able to shew forth great power, which looks small unto the
      understanding of men. And it came to pass that when the brother of Jared had said those words,
      behold, the Lord stretched forth his hand and touched the stones, one by one, with his finger;
      and the veil was taken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the finger of the
      Lord; and it was as the finger of a man, like unto flesh and blood; and the brother of Jared
      fell down before the Lord, for he was struck with fear. And the Lord saw that the brother of
      Jared had fallen to the earth; and the Lord said unto him, Arise, why hast thou fallen down?
      And he saith unto the Lord, I saw the finger of the Lord, and I feared lest he should smite
      me: for I knew not that the Lord had flesh and blood. And the Lord said unto him, Because of
      thy faith thou hast seen that I shall take upon me flesh and blood, and never has man come
      before me with such exceeding faith as thou hast: for were it so, ye could not have seen my
      finger. Sawest thou more than this? And he answered, Nay, Lord, shew thyself unto me. And the
      Lord said unto him, Believest thou the words which I shall speak? And he answered, Yea, Lord,
      I know that thou speakest the truth, for thou art a God of truth, and canst not lie. And when
      he had said these words, behold, the Lord shewed himself unto him, and said, Because thou
      knowest these things, ye are redeemed from the fall; therefore ye are brought back into my
      presence; therefore I shew myself unto you. Behold, I am he which was prepared from the
      foundation of the world, to redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and
      the Son. In me shall all mankind have light, and that eternally, even they which shall believe
      on my name; and they shall become my sons and daughters. And never hath I shewed myself unto
      man whom I have created, for never hath man believed in me as thou hast. Seest thou that ye
      are created after mine own image? Yea, even all men were created, in the beginning, after mine
      own image. Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and man have I
      created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit, will
      I appear unto my people in the flesh. And now, as I Moroni, said I could not make a full
      account of these things which are written, therefore it sufficeth me to say, That Jesus shewed
      himself unto this man in the spirit, even after the manner and in the likeness of the same
      body, even as he shewed himself unto the Nephites; and he ministered unto him, even as he
      ministered unto the Nephites: and all this, that this man knew that he was God, because of the
      many great works which the Lord had shewed unto him. And because of the knowledge of this man,
      he could not be kept from beholding within the veil: and he saw the finger of Jesus, which
      when he saw, he fell with fear: for he knew that it was the finger of the Lord; and he had
      faith no longer, for he knew, nothing doubting; wherefore, having this perfect knowledge of
      God, he could not be kept from within the veil; therefore he saw Jesus, and he did minister
      unto him. And it came to pass that the Lord said unto the brother of Jared, Behold, thou shalt
      not suffer these things which ye have seen and heard, to go forth unto the world, until the
      time cometh that I shall glorify my name in the flesh; wherefore, ye shall treasure up the
      things which ye have seen and heard, and shew it to no man. And behold, when ye shall come
      unto me, ye shall write them and shall seal them up, that no one can interpret them: for ye
      shall write them in a language that they cannot read. And behold, these two stones will I give
      unto thee, and ye shall seal them up also with the things which ye shall write. For behold,
      the language which ye shall write, I have confounded; wherefore I will cause in mine own due
      time that these stones shall magnify to the eyes of men, these things which ye shall write.
      And when the Lord had said these words, the Lord shewed unto the brother of Jared all the
      inhabitants of the earth which had been, and also all that would be; and the Lord withheld
      them not from his sight, even unto the ends of the earth: for the Lord had said unto him in
      times before, that if he would believe in him, that he could shew unto him all things --it
      should be shewn unto him; therefore the Lord could not withhold any thing from him: for he
      knew that the Lord could shew him all things. And the Lord said unto him, Write these things
      and seal them up, and I will shew them in mine own due time unto the children of men. And it
      came to pass that the Lord commanded him that he should seal up the two stones which he had
      received, and shew them not, until the Lord should shew them unto the children of men. </text>

    <text> And the Lord commanded the brother of Jared to go down out of the mount from the presence
      of the Lord, and write the things which he had seen: and they were forbidden to come unto the
      children of men, until after that he should be lifted up upon the cross: and for this cause
      did king Benjamin keep them, that they should not come unto the world until after Christ shew
      himself unto his people. And after that Christ truly had shewed himself unto his people, he
      commanded that they should be made manifest. And now, after that, they have all dwindled in
      unbelief, and there is none, save it be the Lamanites, and they have rejected the Gospel of
      Christ; therefore I am commanded that I should hide them up again in the earth. Behold, I have
      written upon these plates the very things which the brother of Jared saw; and there never was
      greater things made manifest, than that which was made manifest unto the brother of Jared;
      wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me to write them; and I have wrote them. And he commanded
      me that I should seal them up; and he also hath commanded that I should seal up the
      interpretation thereof; wherefore I have sealed up the interpreters. according to the
      commandments of the Lord. For the Lord saith unto me, They shall not go forth unto the
      Gentiles until the day that they shall repent of their iniquity, and become clean before the
      Lord; and in that day that they shall exercise faith in me, saith the Lord, even as the
      brother of Jared did, that they may become sanctified in me, then will I manifest unto them
      the things which the brother of Jared saw, even to the unfolding unto them all my revelations,
      saith Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of the heavens and of the earth, and all things
      that in them is. And he that will contend against the word of the Lord, let him be accursed;
      and he that shall deny these things, saith Jesus Christ, for I am he which speaketh; and at my
      command the heavens are opened and are shut; and at my word, the earth shall shake; and at my
      command the inhabitants thereof shall pass away, even so as by fire; and he that believeth not
      my words, believeth not my disciples; and if it so be that I do not speak, judge ye: for ye
      shall know that it is I that speaketh, at the last day. But he that believeth these things
      which I have spoken, him will I visit with the manifestations of my spirit, and he shall know
      and bear record. For because of my spirit, he shall know that these things are true: for it
      persuadeth men to do good; and whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do good, is of me: for good
      cometh of none, save it be of me. I am the same that leadeth men to all good: he that will not
      believe my words, will not believe me, will not believe the Father which sent me. For behold,
      I am the Father, I am the light, and the life, and the truth of the world. Come unto me, O ye
      Gentiles, and I will shew unto you the greater things, the knowledge which is hid up because
      of unbelief. Come unto me, O ye house of Israel, and it shall be made manifest unto you how
      great things the father hath laid up for you, from the foundation of the world; and it hath
      not come unto you, because of the unbelief. Behold, when ye shall rend that veil of unbelief
      which doth cause you to remain in your awful state of wickedness, and hardness of heart, and
      blindness of mind, then shall the great and marvellous things which have been hid up from the
      foundation of the world from you; yea, when ye shall call upon the father in my name, with a
      broken heart and a contrite spirit, then shall ye know that the Father hath remembered the
      covenant which he made unto your fathers, O house of Israel; and then shall my revelations
      which I have caused to be written by my servant John, be unfolded in the eyes of all the
      people. Remember, when ye see these things, ye shall know that the time is at hand that they
      shall be made manifest in very deed; therefore, when ye shall receive this record, ye may know
      that the work of the Father has commenced upon all the face of the land. Therefore, repent all
      ye ends of the earth, and come unto me, and believe in my Gospel, and be baptized in my name:
      for he that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be
      damned: and signs shall follow them that believe in my name. And blessed is he that is found
      faithful unto my name, at the last day: for they shall be lifted up to dwell in the kingdom
      prepared for them from the foundation of the world. And behold, it is I that hath spoken it.
      Amen. </text>

    <text> And now I, Moroni, have written the words which was commanded me, according to my memory;
      and I have told you the things which I have sealed up; therefore touch them not, in order that
      ye may translate: for that thing is forbidden you, except by and by it shall be wisdom in God.
      And behold, ye may be privileged that ye may shew the plates unto those who shall assist to
      bring forth this work; and unto three shall they be shewn by the power of God; wherefore, they
      shall know of a surety that these things are true. And in the mouth of three witnesses shall
      these things be established; and the testimony of three, and this work, in which shall be
      shewn forth the power of God, and also his word, of which the Father, and the Son, and the
      Holy Ghost beareth record; and all this shall stand as a testimony against the world, at the
      last day. And if it so be that they repent and come unto the Father in the name of Jesus, they
      shall be received into the kingdom of God. And now, if I have no authority for these things,
      judge ye, for ye shall know that I have authority when ye shall see me, and we shall stand

    <text> And now I, Moroni, proceed to give the record of Jared and his brother. For it came to
      pass after that the Lord had prepared the stones which the brother of Jared had carried up
      into the mount, the brother of Jared came down out of the mount, and he did put forth the
      stones into the vessels which were prepared, one in each end thereof; and behold, they did
      give light unto the vessels thereof. And thus the Lord caused the stones to shine in darkness,
      to give light unto men, women and children, that they might not cross the great waters in
      darkness. And it came to pass that when they had prepared all manner of food, that thereby
      they might subsist upon the water, and also food for their flocks and herds, and whatsoever
      beast, or animal, or fowl that they should carry with them. And it came to pass that when they
      had done all these things, they got aboard of their vessels or barges, and set forth into the
      sea, commending themselves unto the Lord their God. And it came to pass that the Lord caused
      that there should a furious wind blow upon the face of the waters, towards the promised land;
      and thus they were tossed upon the waves of the sea before the wind. And it came to pass that
      they were many times buried in the depths of the sea, because of the mountain waves which
      broke upon them, and also the great and terrible tempests which were caused by the fierceness
      of the wind. And it came to pass that when they were buried in the deep, there was no water
      that could hurt them, their vessels being tight like unto a dish, and also they were tight
      like unto the ark of Noah; therefore when they were encompassed about by many waters, they did
      cry unto the Lord, and he did bring them forth again upon the top of the waters. And it came
      to pass that the wind did never cease to blow towards the promised land, while they were upon
      the waters; and thus they were driven forth before the wind; and they did sing praises unto
      the Lord; yea, the brother of Jared did sing praises unto the Lord, and he did thank and
      praise the Lord all the day long; and when the night came, they did not cease to praise the
      Lord. And thus they were driven forth; and no monster of the sea, could break them, neither
      whale that could mar them: and they did have light continually, whether it was above the water
      or under the water. And thus they were driven forth, three hundred and forty and four days
      upon the water; and they did land upon the shore of the promised land. And when they had set
      their feet upon the shores of the promised land, they bowed themselves down upon the face of
      the land, and did humble themselves before the Lord, and did shed tears of joy before the
      Lord, because of the multitude of his tender mercies over them. And it came to pass that they
      went forth upon the face of the land, and began to till the earth. And Jared had four sons;
      and they were called Jacom, and Gilgah, and Mahah, and Orihah. And the brother of Jared also
      begat sons and daughters. And the friend of Jared and his brother, were in number about twenty
      and two souls; and they also begat sons and daughters, before they came to the promised land;
      and therefore they began to be many. And they were taught to walk humbly before the Lord; and
      they were also taught from on high. And it came to pass that they began to spread upon the
      face of the land, and to multiply and to till the earth; and they did wax strong in the land.
      And the brother of Jared began to be old, and saw that he must soon go down to the grave;
      wherefore he saith unto Jared, Let us gather together our people, that we may number them,
      that we may know of them what they will desire of us before we go down to our graves. And
      accordingly the people were gathered together. Now the number of the sons and daughters of the
      brother of Jared were twenty and two souls; and the number of the sons and daughters of Jared
      were twelve, he having four sons. And it came to pass that they did number all their people;
      and after that they had numbered them, they did desire of them the things which they would
      that they should do before they went down to their graves. And it came to pass that the people
      desired of them that they should anoint one of their sons to be a king over them. And now
      behold, this was grievous unto them. --But the brother of Jared said unto them, Surely, this
      thing leadeth into captivity. But Jared said unto his brother, Suffer them that they may have
      a king; and therefore he said unto them, Choose ye out from among our sons a king, even whom
      ye will. And it came to pass that they chose even the first born of the brother of Jared; and
      his name was Pagag. And it came to pass that he refused and would not be their king. And the
      people would that his father should constrain him; but his father would not; and he commanded
      them that they should constrain no man to be their king. And it came to pass that they chose
      all the brothers of Pagag, and they would not. --And it came to pass that neither would the
      sons of Jared, even all, save it were one; and Orihah, he was anointed to be king over the
      people. And he began to reign, and the people began to prosper; and they became exceeding
      rich. And it came to pass that Jared died, and his brother also. And it came to pass that
      Orihah did walk humbly before the Lord, and did remember how great things the Lord had done
      for his father, and also taught his people how great things the Lord had done for their
      fathers. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that Orihah did execute judgment upon the land in righteousness all
      his days, whose days were exceeding many. And he begat sons and daughters; yea, he begat
      thirty and one, among whom were twenty and three sons. And it came to pass that he also begat
      Kib in his old age. And it came to pass that Kib reigned in his stead; and Kib begat Corihor.
      And when Corihor was thirty and two years old, he rebelled against his father, and went over
      and dwelt in the land of Nehor; and he begat sons and daughters; and they became exceeding
      fair; wherefore Corihor drew away many people after him. And when he had gathered together an
      army, he came up unto the land of Moron where the king dwelt, and took him captive, which
      brought to pass the saying of the brother of Jared, That they would be brought into captivity.
      Now the land of Moron where the king dwelt, was near the land which is called Desolation by
      the Nephites. --And it came to pass that Kib dwelt in captivity, and his people, under Corihor
      his son, until he became exceeding old; nevertheless Kib begat Shule in his old age, while he
      was yet in captivity. And it came to pass that Shule was angry with his brother; and Shule
      waxed strong, and became mighty, as to the strength of a man; and he was also mighty in
      judgment. Wherefore he came to the hill Ephraim, and he did moulten out of the hill, and made
      swords out of steel for those which he had drew away with him; and after he had armed them
      with swords, he returned to the city Nehor, and gave battle unto his brother Corihor, by which
      means he obtained the kingdom, and restored it unto his father Kib. And now because of the
      thing which Shule had done, his father bestowed upon him the kingdom; therefore he began to
      reign in the stead of his father. And it came to pass that he did execute judgment in
      righteousness; and he did spread his kingdom upon all the face of the land, for the people had
      become exceeding numerous. --And it came to pass that Shule also begat many sons and
      daughters. And Corihor repented of the many evils which he had done; wherefore Shule gave him
      power in his kingdom. And it came to pass that Corihor had many sons and daughters. --And
      among the sons of Corihor, there was one whose name was Noah. And it came to pass that Noah
      rebelled against Shule, the king, and also his father Corihor, and drew away Cohor his
      brother, and also his brethren and many of the people. --And he gave battle unto Shule, the
      king in the which he did obtain the land of their first inheritance; and he became a king over
      that part of the land. And it came to pass that he gave battle again unto Shule the king; and
      he took Shule the king, and carried him away captive into Moron. And it came to pass as he was
      about to put him to death, the sons of Shule crept into the house of Noah by night and slew
      him, and broke down the door of the prison and brought out their father, and placed him upon
      his throne in his own kingdom; wherefore the son of Noah did build up his kingdom in his
      stead; nevertheless they did not gain power any more over Shule the king; and the people which
      were under the reign of Shule the king, did prosper exceedingly and wax great. And the country
      was divided; and there was two kingdoms, the kingdom of Shule, and the kingdom of Cohor, the
      son of Noah. And Cohor, the son of Noah, caused that his people should give battle unto Shule,
      in the which Shule did beat them, and did slay Cohor. And now Cohor had a son which was called
      Nimrod; and Nimrod gave up the kingdom of Cohor unto Shule, and he did gain favor in the eyes
      of Shule; wherefore Shule did bestow great favor upon him, in the which he did do in the
      kingdom of Shule according to his desires; and also in the reign of Shule there came prophets
      among the people, which were sent from the Lord, prophesying that the wickedness and idolatry
      of the people was bringing a curse upon the land, in the which they should be destroyed, if
      they did not repent. And it came to pass that the people did revile against the prophets, and
      did mock them. And it came to pass that king Shule did execute judgment against all those who
      did revile against the prophets; and he did execute a law throughout all the land, which gave
      power unto the prophets that they should go whithersoever they would; and by this cause the
      people were brought unto repentance. And because the people did repent of their iniquities and
      idolatries, the Lord did spare them, and they began to prosper again in the land. And it came
      to pass that Shule begat sons and daughters in his old age. And there was no more wars in the
      days of Shule; and he remembered the great things that the Lord had done for his fathers in
      bringing them across the great deep into the promised land; wherefore he did execute judgment
      in righteousness all his days. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that he begat Omer, and Omer reigned in his stead. And Omer begat
      Jared; and Jared begat sons and daughters. And Jared rebelled against his father, and came and
      dwelt in the land of Heth. And it came to pass that he did flatter much people, because of his
      cunning words until he had gained the half of the kingdom. And when he had gained the half of
      the kingdom, he gave battle unto his father, and he did carry away his father into captivity,
      and did make him serve in captivity. And now in the days of the reign of Omer, he was in
      captivity the half of his days. And it came to pass that he begat sons and daughters, among
      whom were Esrom and Coriantumr; and they were exceeding angry because of the doings of Jared
      their brother, insomuch that they did raise an army, and gave battle unto Jared. And it came
      to pass that they did give battle unto him by night. --And it came to pass that when they had
      slew the army of Jared, they were about to slay him also; and he plead with them that they
      would not slay him, and he would give up the kingdom unto his father. And it came to pass that
      they did grant unto him his life. And now Jared became exceeding sorrowful because of the loss
      of the kingdom, for he had set his heart upon the kingdom, and upon the glory of the world.
      Now the daughter of Jared being exceeding expert, and seeing the sorrows of her father,
      thought to devise a plan whereby she could redeem the kingdom unto her father. Now the
      daughter of Jared was exceeding fair. And it came to pass that she did talk with her father,
      and saith unto him, Whereby hath my father so much sorrow? Hath he not read the record which
      our fathers brought across the great deep? Behold, is there not an account concerning them of
      old, that they by their secret plans did obtain kingdoms and great glory? And now therefore,
      let my father send for Akish, the son of Kimmer; and behold, I am fair, and I will dance
      before him, and I will please him, that he will desire me to wife; wherefore if he shall
      desire of thee that ye shall give unto him me to wife, then shall ye say, I will give her if
      ye will bring unto me the head of my father, the king. And now Omer was a friend to Akish,
      wherefore when Jared had sent for Akish, the daughter of Jared danced before him, that she
      pleased him, insomuch that he desired her to wife. And it came to pass that he said unto
      Jared, Give her unto me to wife. And Jared said unto him, I will give her unto you, if ye will
      bring unto me the head of my father, the king. And it came to pass that Akish gathered in unto
      the house of Jared all his kinsfolks, and saith unto them, Will ye swear unto me that ye will
      be faithful unto me in the thing which I shall desire of you? And it came to pass that they
      all sware unto him, by the God of Heaven, and also by the Heavens, and also by the earth, and
      by their heads, that whoso should vary from the assistance which Akish desired, should lose
      his head; and whoso should divulge whatsoever thing Akish made known unto them, the same
      should lose his life. And it came to pass that thus they did agree with Akish. And Akish did
      administer unto them the oaths which was given by them of old, who also sought power, which
      had been handed down even from Cain, who was a murderer from the beginning. And they were kept
      up by the power of the devil to administer these oaths unto the people, to keep them in
      darkness, to help such as sought power, to gain power, and to murder, and to plunder, and to
      lie, and to commit all manner of wickedness and whoredoms. --And it was the daughter of Jared
      which put it into his heart to search up these things of old; and Jared put it into the heart
      of Akish; wherefore Akish administered it unto his kindreds and friends, leading them away by
      fair promises to do whatsoever thing he desired. And it came to pass that they formed a secret
      combination, even as they of old; which combination is most abominable and wicked above all,
      in the sight of God: for the Lord worketh not in secret combinations, neither doth he will
      that man should shed blood, but in all things hath forbidden it, from the beginning of man.
      And now I, Moroni, do not write the manner of their oaths and combinations, for it hath been
      made known unto me that they are had among all people, and they are had among the Lamanites,
      and they have caused the destruction of this people of which I am now speaking, and also the
      destruction of the people of Nephi; and whatsoever nation shall uphold such secret
      combinations, to get power and gain, until they shall spread over the nation, behold, they
      shall be destroyed, for the Lord will not suffer that the blood of his saints, which shall be
      shed by them, shall always cry unto him from the ground for the vengeance upon them, and yet
      he avengeth them not; wherefore, O ye Gentiles, it is wisdom in God that these things should
      be shewn unto you, that thereby ye may repent of your sins, and suffer not that these
      murderous combinations shall get above you, which are built up to get power and gain, and the
      work, yea, even the work of destruction come upon you; yea, even the sword of justice of the
      eternal God, shall fall upon you, to your overthrow and destruction, if ye shall suffer these
      things to be; wherefore the Lord commandeth you, when ye shall see these things come among
      you, that ye shall awake to a sense of your awful situation, because of this secret
      combination which shall be among you, or wo be unto it, because of the blood of them which
      have been slain: for they cry from the dust for vengeance upon it, and also upon those who
      build it up. For it cometh to pass that whoso buildeth it up, seeketh to overthrow the freedom
      of all lands, nations and countries; and it bringeth to pass the destruction of all people:
      for it is built up by the devil, which is the father of all lies; even that same liar which
      beguiled our first parents; yea, even the same liar which hath caused man to commit murder
      from the beginning; which hath hardened the hearts of men, that they have murdered the
      prophets, and stoned them, and cast them out from the beginning. Wherefore I, Moroni, am
      commanded to write these things, that evil may be done away, and that the time may come that
      Satan may have no power upon the hearts of the children of men, that they may be persuaded to
      do good continually, that they may come unto the fountain of all righteousness and be saved.

    <text> And now I, Moroni, proceed with my record. Therefore behold, it came to pass that because
      of the secret combinations of Akish and his friends, behold they did overthrow the kingdom of
      Omer; nevertheless, the Lord was merciful unto Omer, and also his sons and daughters, which
      were not, or which did not seek his destruction. And the Lord warned Omer in a dream, that he
      should depart out of the land; wherefore Omer departed out of the land with his family, and
      travelled many days, and came over and passed by the hill of Shim, and came over by the place
      where the Nephites were destroyed, and from thence eastward, and came to a place which was
      called Ablom, by the seashore, and there he pitched his tent, and also his sons and his
      daughters, and all his household, save it were Jared and his family. And it came to pass that
      Jared was anointed king over the people, by the hand of wickedness; and he gave unto Akish his
      daughter to wife. And it came to pass that Akish sought the life of his father-in-law; and he
      applied unto those whom he had sworn by the oath of the ancients, and they obtained the head
      of his father-in-law, as he sat upon his throne, giving audience to his people: for so great
      had been the spreading of this wicked and secret society, that it had corrupted the hearts of
      all the people; therefore Jared was murdered upon his throne, and Akish reigned in his stead.
      And it came to pass that Akish began to be jealous of his son, therefore he shut him up in
      prison, and kept him upon a little or no food, until he had suffered death. And now the
      brother of him that suffered death, that which his father had done unto his brother. And it
      came to pass that Nimrod gathered together a small number of men, and fled out of the land,
      and came over and dwelt with Omer. And it came to pass that Akish begat other sons, and they
      won the hearts of the people, notwithstanding they had sworn unto him to do all manner of
      iniquity, according to that which he desired. Now the people of Akish were desirous for gain,
      even as Akish was desirous of power; wherefore the sons of Akish did offer them money, by the
      which means they drew away the more part of the people after them; and there began to be a war
      between the sons of Akish and Akish, which lasted for the space of many years; yea, unto the
      destruction of nearly all the people of the kingdom; yea, even all, save it were thirty souls,
      and they which fled with the house of Omer; wherefore Omer was restored again to the land of
      his inheritance. And it came to pass that Omer began to be old; nevertheless, in his old age
      he begat Emer; and he anointed Emer to be king to reign in his stead. And after that he
      anointed Emer to be king, he saw peace in the land for the space of two years, and he died,
      having seen exceeding many days, which were full of sorrow. And it came to pass that Emer did
      reign in his stead, and did fill the steps of his father. And the Lord began again to take the
      curse from off the land, and the house of Emer did prosper exceedingly under the reign of
      Emer; and in the space of sixty and two years, they had become exceeding strong, insomuch that
      they became exceeding rich, having all manner of fruit, and of grain, and of silks, and of
      fine linen, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious things, and also all manner of cattle,
      of oxen, and cows, and of sheep, and of swine, and of goats, and also many other kind of
      animals, which were useful for the food of man; and they also had horses, and asses, and there
      were elephants, and cureloms, and cumoms; all of which were useful unto man, and more
      especially the elephants, and cureloms, and cumoms. And thus the Lord did pour out his
      blessings upon this land, which was choice above all other lands; and he commanded that whoso
      should possess the land, should possess it unto the Lord, or they should be destroyed when
      they were ripened in iniquity: for upon such, saith the Lord, I will pour out the fulness of
      my wrath. And Emer did execute judgment in righteousness, all his days; and he begat many sons
      and daughters; and he begat Coriantum; and he anointed Coriantum to reign in his stead. And
      after he anointed Coriantum to reign in his stead, he lived four years, and he saw peace in
      the land; yea, and he even saw the son of righteousness, and did rejoice and glory in his
      days; and he died in peace. And it came to pass that Coriantum did walk in the steps of his
      father, and did build many mighty cities, and did administer that which is good unto his
      people, in all his days. And it came to pass that he had no children, even until he was
      exceeding old. And it came to pass that his wife died, being an hundred and two years old. And
      it came to pass that Coriantum took to wife, in his old age, a young maid, and begat sons and
      daughters; wherefore he lived until he was an hundred and forty and two years old. And it came
      to pass that he begat Com, and Com reigned in his stead; and he reigned forty and nine years,
      and he begat Heth, and he also begat other sons and daughters. And the people had spread again
      over all the face of the land, and there began to be an exceeding great wickedness upon the
      face of the land, and Heth began to embrace the secret plans again of old, to destroy his
      father. And it came to pass that he did dethrone his father: for he slew him with his own
      sword; and he did reign in his stead. And there came prophets in the land again, crying
      repentance unto them; that they must prepare the way of the Lord, or there should come a curse
      upon the face of the land; yea, even there should be a great famine, in the which they should
      be destroyed, if they did not repent. But the people believed not the words of the prophets,
      but they cast them out; and some of them they cast into pits, and left them to perish. And it
      came to pass that they done all these things according to the commandment of the king Heth.
      And it came to pass that there began to be a great dearth upon the land, and the inhabitants
      began to be destroyed exceeding fast, because of the dearth: for there was no rain upon the
      face of the earth; and there came forth poisonous serpents also upon the face of the land, and
      did poison many people. And it came to pass that their flocks began to flee before the
      poisonous serpents, towards the land southward, which was called by the Nephites, Zarahemla.
      And it came to pass that there were many of them which did perish by the way; nevertheless,
      there were some which fled into the land southward. And it came to pass that the Lord did
      cause the serpents that they should pursue them no more, but that they should hedge up the
      way, that the people could not pass; that whoso should attempt to pass, might fall by the
      poisonous serpents. And it came to pass that the people did follow the course of the beasts,
      and did devour the carcasses of them which fell by the way, until they had devoured them all.
      Now when the people saw that they must perish, they began to repent of their iniquities, and
      cry unto the Lord. And it came to pass that when they humbled themselves sufficiently before
      the Lord, the Lord did send rain upon the face of the earth, and the people began to revive
      again, and there began to be fruits in the north countries, and in all the countries round
      about. And the Lord did shew forth his power unto them, in preserving them from famine.

    <text> And it came to pass that Shez, which was a descendant of Heth, for Heth had perished by
      the famine, and all his household, save it were Shez: wherefore Shez began to build up again a
      broken people. And it came to pass that Shez did remember the destruction of his fathers, and
      he did build up a righteous kingdom, for he remembered what the Lord had done in bringing
      Jared and his brother across the deep; and he did walk in the ways of the Lord, and he begat
      sons and daughters. And his eldest son, whose name was Shez, did rebel against him;
      nevertheless, Shez was smitten by the hand of a robber, because of his exceeding riches, which
      brought peace again unto his father. And it came to pass that his father did build up many
      cities upon the face of the land, and the people began again to spread over all the face of
      the land. And Shez did live to an exceeding old age; and he begat Riplakish, and he died. And
      Riplakish reigned in his stead. And it came to pass that Riplakish did not do that which was
      right in the sight of the Lord, for he did have many wives and concubines, and did lay that
      upon men's shoulders which was grievous to be borne; yea, he did tax them with heavy taxes;
      and with the taxes he did build many spacious buildings. And he did erect him an exceeding
      beautiful throne, and he did build many prisons, and whoso were not able to pay taxes he did
      cast into prison; and he did cause that they should labor continually for their support; and
      whoso refused to labor, he did cause to be put to death; wherefore he did obtain all his fine
      work; yea, even his fine gold he did cause to be refined in prison, and all manner of fine
      workmanship he did cause to be wrought in prison. And it came to pass that he did afflict the
      people with his whoredoms and abominations; and when he had reigned for the space of forty and
      two years, the people did raise up in rebellion against him, and there began to be war again
      in the land, insomuch that Riplakish was killed and his descendants were driven out of the
      land. And it came to pass after a space of many years, Morianton, (he being a descendant of
      Riplakish,) gathered together an army of outcasts, and went forth and gave battle unto the
      people; and he gained power over many cities; and the war became exceeding sore, and did last
      for the space of many years, and he did gain power over all the land, and did establish
      himself king over all the land. And after that he established himself king, he did ease the
      burden of the people, in the which he did gain favor in the eyes of the people, and they did
      anoint him to be their king. And he did do justice unto the people, but not unto himself,
      because of his many whoredoms; wherefore he was cut off from the presence of the Lord. And it
      came to pass that Morianton built up many cities, and the people became exceeding rich under
      his reign, both in buildings, and in gold, and in silver, and in raising grain, and in flocks,
      and herds, and such things which had been restored unto them. And Morianton did live to an
      exceeding great age, and then he begat Kim; and Kim did reign in the stead of his father; and
      he did reign eight years, and his father died. And it came to pass that Kim did not reign in
      righteousness, wherefore he was not favored of the Lord. And his brother did raise up in
      rebellion against him, in the which he did bring him into captivity; and he did remain in
      captivity all his days; and he begat sons and daughters in captivity; and in his old age he
      begat Levi, and he died. And it came to pass that Levi did serve in captivity after the death
      of his father, for the space of forty and two years. And he did make war against the king of
      the land, in the which he did obtain unto himself the kingdom. And after that he had obtained
      unto himself the kingdom, he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord; and the people
      did prosper in the land, and he did live to a good old age, and begat sons and daughters; and
      he also begat Corom, whom he anointed in his stead. And it came to pass that Corom did that
      which was good in the sight of the Lord, all his days; and he begat many sons and daughters;
      and after that he had seen many days, he did pass away, even like unto the rest of the earth;
      and Kish reigned in his stead. And it came to pass that Kish passed away also, and Lib reigned
      in his stead. And it came to pass that Lib also did that which was good in the sight of the
      Lord. And in the days of Lib the poisonous serpents were destroyed; wherefore they did go into
      the land southward, to hunt food for the people of the land; for the land was covered with
      animals of the forest. And Lib also became a great hunter. --And they built a great city by
      the narrow neck of land, by the place where the sea divides the land. And they did preserve
      the land southward for a wilderness, to get game. And the whole face of the land northward was
      covered with inhabitants; and they were exceeding industrious, and they did buy and sell, and
      traffic one with another, that they might get gain. And they did work in all manner of ore,
      and they did make gold, and silver, and iron, and brass, and all manner of metals; and they
      did dig it out of the earth; wherefore they did cast up mighty heaps of earth for to get ore,
      of gold, and of silver, and of iron, and of copper. And they did work all manner of fine work.
      And they did have silks, and fine twined linen; and they did work all manner of cloth, that
      they might clothe themselves from their nakedness. And they did make all manner of tools to
      till the earth, both to plough and to sow, to reap and to hoe, and also to thrash. And they
      did make all manner of tools in the which they did work their beasts. And they did make all
      manner of weapons of war. And they did work all manner of work of exceeding curious
      workmanship. And never could be a people more blessed than were they. and more prospered by
      the hand of the Lord. And they were in a land that was choice above all lands, for the Lord
      had spoken it. And it came to pass that Lib did live many years, and begat sons and daughters;
      and he also begat Hearthom. And it came to pass that Hearthom reigned in the stead of his
      father. And when Hearthom had reigned twenty and four years, behold the kingdom was taken away
      from him. And he served many years in captivity; yea, even all the remainder of his days. And
      he begat Heth, and Heth lived in captivity all his days. And Heth begat Aaron, and Aaron dwelt
      in captivity all his days; and he begat Amnigaddah, and Amnigaddah also dwelt in captivity in
      all his days; and he begat Coriantum, and Coriantum dwelt in captivity all his days; and he
      begat Com. And it came to pass that Com drew away the half of the kingdom. And he reigned over
      the half of the kingdom forty and two years; and he went to battle against the king Amgid, and
      they fought for the space of many years, in the which Com gained power over Amgid and obtained
      power over the remainder of the kingdom. And in the days of Com there began to be robbers in
      the land; and they adopted the old plans, and administered oaths after the manner of the
      ancients, and sought to destroy the kingdom. Now Com did fight against them much;
      nevertheless, he did not prevail against them. </text>

    <text> And there came also in the days of Com many prophets, and prophesied of the destruction
      of that great people, except they should repent and turn unto the Lord, and forsake their
      murders and wickedness. And it came to pass that the prophets were rejected by the people, and
      they fled unto Com for protection, for the people sought to destroy them; and they prophesied
      unto Com many things: and he was blessed in all the remainder of his days. And he lived to a
      good old age, and begat Shiblom; and Shiblom reigned in his stead. And the brother of Shiblom
      rebelled against him; and there began to be an exceeding great war in all the land. And it
      came to pass that the brother of Shiblom did cause that all the prophets which prophesied of
      the destruction of the people, should be put to death; and there was great calamity in all the
      land: for they had testified that a great curse should come upon the land, and also upon the
      people, and that there should be a great destruction among them, such an one as never had been
      upon the face of the earth; and their bones should become as heaps of earth upon the face of
      the land, except they should repent of their wickedness. And they hearkened not unto the voice
      of the Lord, because of their wicked combinations; wherefore there began to be wars and
      contentions in all the land, and also many famines and pestilences, insomuch that there was a
      great destruction, such an one as never had been known upon the face of the earth: and all
      this came to pass in the days of Shiblom. And the people began to repent of their iniquity;
      inasmuch as they did, the Lord did have mercy on them. And it came to pass that Shiblom was
      slain, and Seth was brought into captivity; and he did dwell in captivity all his days. And it
      came to pass that Ahah, his son, did obtain the kingdom; and he did reign over the people all
      his days. And he did do all manner of iniquity in his days, in the which he did cause the
      shedding of much blood; and few were his days. And Ethem, being a descendant of Ahah, did
      obtain the kingdom; and he also did do that which was wicked in his days. And it came to pass
      in the days of Ethem, there came many prophets and prophesied again unto the people; yea, they
      did prophesy that the Lord would utterly destroy them from off the face of the earth, except
      they repented of their iniquities. And it came to pass that the people hardened their hearts,
      and would not hearken unto their words; and the prophets mourned and withdrew from among the
      people. And it came to pass that Ethem did execute judgment in wickedness all his days; and he
      begat Moron. And it came to pass that Moron did reign in his stead; and Moron did do that
      which was wicked before the Lord. And it came to pass that there arose a rebellion among the
      people, because of that secret combination which was built up to get power and gain; and there
      arose a mighty man among them in iniquity, and gave battle unto Moron, in the which he did
      overthrow the half of the kingdom; and he did maintain the half of the kingdom for many years.
      And it came to pass that Moron did overthrow him, and did obtain the kingdom again. And it
      came to pass that there arose another mighty man; and he was a descendant of the brother of
      Jared. And it came to pass that he did overthrow Moron and obtain the kingdom; wherefore Moron
      dwelt in captivity all the remainder of his days; and he begat Coriantor. And it came to pass
      that Coriantor dwelt in captivity all his days. And in the days of Coriantor there also came
      many prophets, and prophesied of great and marvellous things, and cried repentance unto the
      people, and except they should repent, the Lord God would execute judgment against them to
      their utter destruction; and that the Lord God would send or bring forth another people to
      possess the land, by his power, after the manner which he brought their fathers. And they did
      reject all the words of the prophets, because of their secret society and wicked abominations.
      And it came to pass that Coriantor begat Ether, and he died, having dwelt in captivity all his
      days. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that the days of Ether was in the days of Coriantumr; and Coriantumr
      was king over all the land. --And Ether was a prophet of the Lord; wherefore Ether came forth
      in the days of Coriantumr, and began to prophesy unto the people, for he could not be
      constrained because of the spirit of the Lord which was in him: for he did cry from the
      morning, even until the going down of the sun, exhorting the people to believe in God unto
      repentance, lest they should be destroyed saying unto them, That by faith all things are
      fulfilled; wherefore, whoso believeth in God, might with surety hope for a better world, yea,
      even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the
      souls of men; which make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to
      glorify God. And it came to pass that Ether did prophesy great and marvellous things unto the
      people. which they did not believe, because they saw them not. And Now I, Moroni, would speak
      somewhat concerning these things: I would shew unto the world that faith is things which are
      hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness
      until after the trial of your faith: for it was by faith that Christ shewed himself unto our
      fathers, after that he had risen from the dead; and he shewed not himself unto them, until
      after they had faith in him, for he shewed himself not unto the world. But because of the
      faith of men, he has shewn himself unto the world, and glorified the name of the Father, and
      prepared a way that thereby others might be partakers of the heavenly gift, that they might
      hope for those things which they have not seen; wherefore ye may also have hope, and be
      partakers of the gift, if ye will have faith. Behold, it was by faith that they of old were
      called after the holy order of God; wherefore by faith was the law of Moses given. But in the
      gift of his Son, hath God prepared a more excellent way; and it is by faith that it hath been
      fulfilled: for if there be no faith among the children of men, God can do no miracle among
      them; wherefore he shewed not himself until after their faith. Behold, it was the faith of
      Alma and Amulek that caused the prison to tumble to the earth. Behold, it was the faith of
      Nephi and Lehi, that wrought the change upon the Lamanites, that they were baptized with fire
      and with the Holy Ghost. Behold it was the faith of Ammon and his brethren which wrought so
      great a miracle among the Lamanites; yea, and even all they which wrought miracles, wrought
      them by faith, even those which were before Christ, and also them which were after. And it was
      by faith that the three disciples obtained a promise that they should not taste of death; and
      they obtained not the promise until after their faith. And neither at any time hath any
      wrought miracles until after their faith; wherefore they first believed in the Son of God. And
      there were many whose faith was so exceeding strong even before Christ came, which could not
      be kept from within the veil, but truly saw with their eyes the things which they had beheld
      with an eye of faith, and they were glad. And behold, we have seen in this record, that one of
      these was the brother of Jared: for so great was his faith in God, that when God put forth his
      finger, he could not hide it from the sight of the brother of Jared, because of his word which
      he had spoken unto him, which word he had obtained by faith. And after that the brother of
      Jared had beheld the finger of the Lord, because of the promise which the brother of Jared had
      obtained by faith, the Lord could not withhold any thing from his sight; wherefore he shewed
      him all things, for he could no longer be kept without the veil. And it is by faith that my
      fathers have obtained the promise that these things should come unto their brethren through
      the Gentiles; therefore the Lord hath commanded me, yea, even Jesus Christ. And I said unto
      him, Lord, the Gentiles will mock at these things because of our weakness in writing: for
      Lord, thou hast made us mighty in word by faith, whereunto thou hast not made us mighty in
      writing: for thou hast made all this people that they could speak much, because of the Holy
      Ghost which thou hast given them; and thou hast made us that we could write but little,
      because of the awkwardness of our hands. Behold, thou hast not made us mighty in writing like
      unto the brother of Jared, for thou madest him that the things which he wrote, were mighty
      even as thou art, unto the overpowering of man to read them. Thou hast also made our words
      powerful and great, even that we cannot write them; wherefore, when we write, we behold our
      weakness, and stumble because of the placing of our words; and I fear lest the Gentiles shall
      mock at our words. And when I had said this, the Lord spake unto me, saying, Fools mock, but
      they shall mourn; and my grace is sufficient for the meek, that they shall take no advantage
      of your weakness: and if men come unto me, I will shew unto them their weakness. I give unto
      men weakness, that they may be humble. and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble
      themselves before me: for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will
      I make weak things become strong unto them. Behold, I will shew unto the Gentiles their
      weakness, and I will shew unto them that faith, hope, and charity, bringeth unto me the
      fountain of all righteousness. And I, Moroni, having heard these words, was comforted, and
      said, O Lord, thy righteous will be done, for I know that thou workest unto the children of
      men according to their faith: for the brother of Jared said unto the mountain Zerin, Remove,
      and it was removed. And if he had not faith, it would not have moved; wherefore thou workest
      after that men have faith: for thus did thou manifest thyself unto thy disciples. For after
      that they had faith, and did speak in thy name, thou didst shew thyself unto them in great
      power; and I also rememberest that thou hast said that thou hast prepared a house for man;
      yea, even among the mansions of thy Father, in the which man might have a more excellent hope;
      wherefore man must hope, or he cannot receive an inheritance in the place which thou hast
      prepared. And again I remember that thou hast said that thou loved the world, even unto the
      laying down of thy life for the world, that thou mightest take it again to prepare a place for
      the children of men. And now I know that this love which thou hast had for the children of
      men, is charity; wherefore, except men shall have charity, they cannot inherit that place
      which thou hast prepared in the mansions of they Father. Wherefore, I know by this thing which
      thou hast said, that if the Gentiles have not charity because of our weakness, that thou wilt
      prove them, and take away their talent, yea, even that which they have received, and give unto
      them which shall have more abundantly. And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord that he
      would give unto the Gentiles grace, that they might have charity. And it came to pass that the
      Lord said unto me, if they have not charity, it mattereth not unto thee, thou hast been
      faithful; wherefore thy garments shall be made clean. And because thou hast seen thy weakness,
      thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which I have prepared in
      the mansions of my Father. And now I, Moroni, bid farewell unto the Gentiles, yea, and also
      unto my brethren whom I love, until we shall meet before the judgment seat of Christ, where
      all men shall know that my garments are not spotted with your blood; and then shall ye know
      that I have seen Jesus, and that he hath talked with me face to face, and that he told me in
      plain humility, even as a man telleth another in mine own language, concerning these things;
      and only a few have I written, because of my weakness in writing. And now I would commend you
      to seek this Jesus of whom the prophets and Apostles have written, that the Grace of God the
      Father, and also the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of them, may
      be, and abide in you forever. Amen. </text>

    <text> And now I, Moroni, proceed to finish my record concerning the destruction of the people
      of which I have been writing. --For behold, they rejected all the words of Ether: for he truly
      told them of all things, from the beginning of man; and how that after the waters had receded
      from off the face of this land, it became a choice land above all other lands, a chosen land
      of the Lord; wherefore the Lord would have that all men should serve him, which dwelleth upon
      the face thereof; and that it was the place of the New Jerusalem, which should come down out
      of Heaven, and the Holy Sanctuary of the Lord. Behold, Ether saw the days of Christ, and he
      spake concerning a New Jerusalem upon this land; and he spake also concerning the house of
      Israel, and the Jerusalem from whence Lehi should come; after that it should be destroyed, it
      should be built up again a holy city unto the Lord; wherefore it could not be a New Jerusalem,
      for it had been in a time of old, but it should be built up again, and become a holy city of
      the Lord; and it should be built up unto the house of Israel; and that a New Jerusalem should
      be built up upon this land, unto the remnant of the seed of Joseph, for the which things there
      has been a type: for as Joseph brought his father down into the land of Egypt, even so he died
      there; wherefore the Lord brought a remnant of the seed of Joseph out of the land of
      Jerusalem, that he might be merciful unto the seed of Joseph, that they should perish not,
      even as he was merciful unto the father of Joseph, that he should perish not; wherefore the
      remnant of the house of Joseph shall be built upon this land; and it shall be a land of their
      inheritance; and they shall build up a holy city unto the Lord, like unto the Jerusalem of
      old; and they shall no more be confounded, until the end come, when the earth shall pass away.
      And there shall be a new heaven and a new earth; and they shall be like unto the old, save the
      old have passed away, and all things have become new. And then cometh the New Jerusalem; and
      blessed are they which dwell therein, for it is they whose garment are white through the blood
      of the Lamb; and they are they which are numbered among the remnant of the seed of Joseph,
      which were of the house of Israel. And then also cometh the Jerusalem of old; and the
      inhabitants thereof, blessed are they, for they have been washed in the blood of the Lamb; and
      they are they which were scattered and gathered in from the four quarters of the earth, and
      from the north countries, and are partakers of the fulfilling of the covenant which God made
      with their father Abraham. And when these things come, bringeth to pass the Scripture which
      saith, There are they which were first, which shall be last; and there are they which were
      last, which shall be first. And I was about to write more, but I am forbidden; but great and
      marvellous were the prophecies of Ether, but they esteemed him as nought, and cast him out,
      and he hid himself in the cavity of a rock by day, and by night he went forth viewing the
      things which should come upon the people. And as he dwelt in the cavity of a rock, he made the
      remainder of this record, viewing the destructions which came upon the people by night. And it
      came to pass that in that same year which he was cast out from among the people, there began
      to be a great war among the people, for there were many which rose up who were mighty men, and
      sought to destroy Coriantumr by their secret plans of wickedness, of which hath been spoken.
      And now Coriantumr, having studied himself in all the arts of war, and all the cunning of the
      world, wherefore he gave battle unto them which sought to destroy him; but he repented not,
      neither his fair sons nor daughters; neither the fair sons and daughters of Cohor; neither the
      fair sons and daughters of Corihor; and in fine, there was none of the fair sons and daughters
      upon the face of the whole earth, which repented of their sins; wherfore it came to pass that
      in the first year that Ether dwelt in the cavity of a rock, there was many people which was
      slain by the sword of those secret combinations fighting against Coriantumr, that they might
      obtain the kingdom. And it came to pass that the sons of Coriantumr fought much, and bled
      much. And in the second year, the word of the Lord came to Ether, that he should go and
      prophesy unto Coriantumr, that if he would repent, and all his household, the Lord would give
      unto him his kingdom, and spare the people, otherwise they should be destroyed, and all his
      household, save it were himself, and he should only live to see the fulfilling of the
      prophecies which had been spoken concerning another people receiving the land for their
      inheritance; and Coriantumr should receive a burial by them; and every soul should be
      destroyed save it were Coriantumr. And it came to pass that Coriantumr repented not, neither
      his household, neither the people; and the wars did cease not; and they sought to kill Ether,
      but he fled from before them, and hid again in the cavity of the rock. And it came to pass
      that there arose up Shared, and he also gave battle unto Coriantumr; and he did beat him,
      insomuch that in the third year he did bring him into captivity. And the sons of Coriantumr,
      in the fourth year, did beat Shared, and did obtain the kingdom again unto their father. Now
      there began to be a war upon all the face of the land, every man with his band, fighting for
      that which he desired. And there was robbers, and in fine, all manner of wickedness upon all
      the face of the land. And it came to pass that Coriantumr was exceeding angry with Shared, and
      he went against him with his armies, to battle; and they did meet in great anger; and they did
      meet in the valley of Gilgal; and the battle became exceeding sore. --And it came to pass that
      Shared fought against him for the space of three days. And it came to pass that Coriantumr
      beat him, and did pursue him until he came to the plains of Heshlon. And it came to pass that
      Shared gave him battle again upon the plains; and behold, he did beat Coriantumr, and drove
      him back again to the valley of Gilgal. And Coriantumr gave Shared battle again in the valley
      of Gilgal, in the which he beat Shared, and slew him. And Shared wounded Coriantumr, in his
      thigh, that he did not go to battle again for the space of two years, in the which time all
      the people upon all the face of the land were a shedding blood, and there was none to
      constrain them. </text>

    <text> And now there began to be a great curse upon the land, because of the iniquity of the
      people, in the which, if a man should lay his tool or his sword upon the shelf, or upon the
      place whither he would keep it, and behold, upon the morrow, he could not find it, so great
      was the curse upon the land. Wherefore every man did cleave unto that which was his own, with
      his hands, and would not borrow, neither would he lend; and every man kept the hilt of his
      sword thereof, in his right hand, in the defence of his property and his own life, and they of
      his wives and children. And now after the space of two years, and after the death of Shared,
      behold, there arose the brother of Shared, and he gave battle unto Coriantumr, in the which
      Coriantumr did beat him, and did pursue him to the wilderness of Akish. And it came to pass
      that the brother of Shared did give battle unto him in the wilderness of Akish; and the battle
      became exceeding sore, and many thousands fell by the sword. And it came to pass that
      Coriantumr did lay siege to the wilderness, and the brother of Shared did march forth out of
      the wilderness by night, and slew a part of the army of Coriantumr, as they were drunken. And
      he came forth to the land of Moron, and placed himself upon the throne of Coriantumr. And it
      came to pass that Coriantumr dwelt with his army in the wilderness, for the space of two
      years, in the which he did receive great strength to his army. Now the brother of Shared,
      whose name was Gilead, also received great strength to his army, because of secret
      combinations. And it came to pass that his High Priest murdered him as he sat upon his throne.
      And it came to pass that one of the secret combinations murdered him in the secret pass, and
      obtained unto himself the kingdom; and his name was Lib; and Lib was a man of great stature,
      more than any other man among all the people. And it came to pass that in the first year of
      Lib, Coriantumr came up unto the land of Moron, and gave battle with Lib, in the which Lib did
      smite upon his arm, that he was wounded; nevertheless, the army of Coriantumr did press
      forward upon Lib, that he fled to the borders upon the seashore. And it came to pass that
      Coriantumr pursued him; and Lib gave battle unto him upon the seashore. And it came to pass
      that Lib did smite the army of Coriantumr, that they fled again to the wilderness of Akish.
      And it came to pass that Lib did pursue him until he came to the plains of Agosh. And
      Coriantumr had taken all the people with him, as he fled before Lib, in that quarter of the
      land whither he fled. And when he had come to the plains of Agosh, he gave battle unto Lib,
      and he smote upon him until he died; nevertheless, the brother of Lib did come against
      Coriantumr in the stead thereof, and the battle became exceeding sore, in the which Coriantumr
      fled again before the army of the brother of Lib. Now the name of the brother of Lib was
      called Shiz. And it came to pass that Shiz pursued after Coriantumr, and he did overthrow many
      cities, and he did slay both women and children, and he did burn the cities thereof; and there
      went a fear of Shiz throughout all the land; yea, a cry went forth throughout the land: Who
      can stand before the army of Shiz? Behold, he sweepeth the earth before him! And it came to
      pass that the people began to flock together in armies, throughout all the face of the land.
      And they were divided, and a part of them fled to the army of Shiz, and a part of them fled to
      the army of Coriantumr. --And so great and lasting had been the war, and so long had been the
      scene of bloodshed and carnage, that the whole face of the land was covered with the bodies of
      the dead; and so swift and speedy was the war, that there was none left to bury the dead, but
      they did march forth from the shedding of blood, to the shedding of blood, leaving the bodies
      of both men, women and children, strewed upon the face of the land, to become a prey to the
      worms of the flesh; and the scent thereof went forth upon the face of the land, even upon all
      the face of the land; wherefore the people became troubled by day and by night, because of the
      scent thereof; nevertheless, Shiz did not cease to pursue Coriantumr, for he had sworn to
      avenge himself upon Coriantumr of the blood of his brother, which had been slain, and the word
      of the Lord which came to Ether, that Coriantumr should not fall by the sword. And thus we see
      that the Lord did visit them in the fulness of his wrath, and their wickedness and
      abominations had prepared a way for their everlasting destruction. And it came to pass that
      Shiz did pursue Coriantumr eastward, even to the borders by the seashore, and there he gave
      battle unto Shiz for the space of three days; and so terrible was the destruction among the
      armies of Shiz, that the people began to be frightened, and began to flee before the armies of
      Coriantumr; and they fled to the land of Corihor, and swept off the inhabitants before them,
      all they that would not join them; and they pitched their tents in the valley of Corihor. And
      Coriantumr pitched his tents in the valley of Shurr. Now the valley of Shurr was near the hill
      Comnor; wherefore Coriantumr did gather his armies together, upon the hill of Comnor, and did
      sound a trumpet unto the armies of Shiz, to invite them forth to battle. And it came to pass
      that they came forth, but were driven back again; and they came a second time; and they were
      driven again a second time. And it came to pass that they came again the third time, and the
      battle became exceeding sore. And it came to pass that Shiz smote upon Coriantumr, that he
      gave him many deep wounds. And Coriantumr having lost his blood, fainted, and was carried away
      as though he were dead. Now the loss of men, women and children, on both sides, were so great
      that Shiz commanded his people that they should not pursue the armies of Coriantumr; wherefore
      they returned to their camp. </text>

    <text> And it came to pass that when Coriantumr had recovered of his wounds, he began to
      remember the words which Ether had spoken unto him: He saw that there had been slain by the
      sword already nearly two millions of his people, and he began to sorrow in his heart; yea,
      there had been slain two millions of mighty men, and also their wives and their children. He
      began to repent of the evil which he had done; he began to remember the words which had been
      spoken by the mouth of all the prophets, and he saw them that they were fulfilled, thus far,
      every whit; and his soul mourned, and refused to be comforted. And it came to pass that he
      wrote an epistle unto Shiz, desiring him that he would spare the people, and he would give up
      the kingdom for the sake of the lives of the people. And it came to pass that when Shiz had
      received his epistle, he wrote an epistle unto Coriantumr, that if he would give himself up,
      that he might slay him with his own sword, that he would spare the lives of the people. And it
      came to pass that the people repented not of their iniquity; and the people of Coriantumr were
      stirred up to anger against the people of Shiz; and the people of Shiz were stirred up to
      anger against the people of Coriantumr; wherefore the people of Shiz did battle unto the
      people of Coriantumr. --And when Coriantumr saw that he was about to fall, he fled again
      before the people of Shiz. And it came to pass that he came to the waters of Ripliancum,
      which, by interpretation, is large, or to exceed all; wherefore, when they came to these
      waters, they pitched their tents; and Shiz also pitched his tents, near unto them; and
      therefore, on the morrow, they did come to battle. And it came to pass that they fought an
      exceeding sore battle, in the which Coriantumr was wounded again, and he fainted with the loss
      of blood. And it came to pass that the armies of Coriantumr did press upon the armies of Shiz,
      that they beat them, that they caused them to flee before them; and they did flee southward,
      and did pitch their tents in a place which was called Ogath. And it came to pass that the army
      of Coriantumr did pitch their tents by the hill Ramah; and it was the same hill where my
      father Mormon did hide up the records unto the Lord, which were sacred. --And it came to pass
      that they did gather together all the people, upon all the face of the land, which had not
      been slain, save it were Ether. And it came to pass that Ether did behold all the doings of
      the people; and he beheld that the people which were for Coriantumr, were gathered together to
      the army of Coriantumr; and the people which were for Shiz, were gathered together to the army
      of Shiz; wherefore they were for the space of four years, gathering together the people, that
      they might get all which were upon the face of the land, and that they might receive all the
      strength which it were possible that they could receive. And it came to pass that when they
      were all gathered together, every one to the army which he would, with their wives, and their
      children; both men, women and children being armed with weapons of war, having shields, and
      breast-plates, and head-plates, and being clothed after the manner of war, they did march
      forth one against another, to battle; and they fought all that day, and conquered not. And it
      came to pass that when it was night they were weary, and retired to their camps; and after
      that they had retired to their camps, they took up a howling and a lamentation for the loss of
      the slain people; and so great were their cries, their howlings and lamentations, that it did
      rend the air exceedingly. And it came to pass that on the morrow they did go again to battle,
      and great and terrible was that day; nevertheless they conquered not, and when the night came
      again, they did rend the air with their cries, and their howlings, and their mournings, for
      the loss of the slain of their people. And it came to pass that Coriantumr wrote again an
      epistle unto Shiz, desiring that he would not come again to battle but that he would take the
      kingdom, and spare the lives of the people. But behold, the spirit of the Lord had ceased
      striving with them, and Satan had full power over the hearts of the people, for they were
      given up unto the hardness of their hearts, and the blindness of their minds, that they might
      be destroyed; wherefore they went again to battle. And it came to pass that they fought all
      that day, and when the night came they slept upon their swords; and on the morrow they fought
      even until the night came; and when the night came they were drunken with anger, even as a man
      which is drunken with wine and they slept again upon their swords; and on the morrow they
      fought again; and when the night came they had all fallen by the sword, save it were fifty and
      two of the people of Coriantumr, and sixty and nine of the people of Shiz. And it came to pass
      that they slept upon their swords that night, and on the morrow they fought again, and they
      contended in their mights with their swords, and with their shields, all that day; and when
      the night came there was thirty and two of the people of Shiz, and twenty and seven of the
      people of Coriantumr. And it came to pass that they ate and slept, and prepared for death on
      the morrow. And they were large and mighty men, as to the strength of men. And it came to pass
      that they fought for the space of three hours, and they fainted with the loss of blood. And it
      came to pass that when the men of Coriantumr had received sufficient strength, that they could
      walk, they were about to flee for their lives, but behold, Shiz arose, and also his men, and
      he swore in his wrath that he would slay Coriantumr, or he would perish by the sword;
      wherefore he did pursue them; and they fought again with the sword. And it came to pass that
      when they had all fallen by the sword, save it were Coriantumr and Shiz, behold, Shiz had
      fainted with loss of blood. And it came to pass that when Coriantumr had leaned upon his
      sword, that he rested a little, he smote off the head of Shiz. And it came to pass that after
      he had smote off the head of Shiz, that Shiz raised upon his hands and fell; and after that he
      had struggled for breath, he died. And it came to pass that Coriantumr fell to the earth, and
      became as if he had no life. And the Lord spake unto Ether, and said unto him, Go forth. And
      he went forth, and beheld that the words of the Lord had all been fulfilled; and he finished
      his record; (and the hundredth part I have not written,) and he hid them in a manner that the
      people of Limhi did find them. Now the last words which are written by Ether are these:
      Whether the Lord will that I be translated, or that I suffer the will of the Lord in the
      flesh: It mattereth not, if it so be that I am saved in the kingdom of God. Amen. </text>

    <text> Now I, Moroni, after having made an end of abridging the account of the people of Jared,
      I had supposed not to have written more, but I have not as yet perished; and I make not myself
      known to the Lamanites, lest they should destroy me. For behold, their wars are exceeding
      fierce among themselves; and because of their hatred, they put to death every Nephite that
      will not deny Christ. And I, Moroni, will not deny the Christ; wherefore, I wander
      whithersoever I can, for the safety of mine own life. Wherefore, I write a few more things,
      contrary to that which I had supposed: for I had supposed not to have written any more; but I

    <text> And now I speak concerning baptism. Behold, elders, priests, and teachers were baptized;
      and they were not baptized, save they brought forth fruit meet that they were worthy of it;
      neither did they receive any unto baptism, save they came forth with a broken heart and a
      contrite spirit, and witnessed unto the church that they truly repented of all their sins. And
      none were received unto baptism, save they took upon them the name of Christ, having a
      determination to serve him unto the end. And after they had been received unto baptism, and
      were wrought upon and cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost, they were numbered among the
      people of the church of Christ, and their names were taken, that they might be remembered and
      nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, to keep them continually
      watchful unto prayer, relying alone upon the merits of Christ, who was the author and the
      finisher of their faith. And the church did meet together oft, to fast and to pray, and to
      speak one with another concerning the welfare of their souls; and they did meet together oft
      to partake of the bread and wine, in remembrance of the Lord Jesus; and they were strict to
      observe that there should be no iniquity among them; and whoso was found to commit iniquity,
      and three witnesses of the church did condemn them before the elders; if they repented not,
      and confessed not, their names were blotted out, and they were not numbered among the people
      of Christ; but as oft as they repented, and sought forgiveness, with real intent, they were
      forgiven. And their meetings were conducted by the church, after the manner of the workings of
      the spirit, and by the power of the Holy Ghost: for as the power of the Holy Ghost led them
      whether to preach, or exhort, or to pray, or to supplicate, or to sing, even so it was done.

    <text> And now I, Moroni, write a few of the words of my father Mormon, which he spake
      concerning faith, hope, and charity: for after this manner did he speak unto the people as he
      taught them in the synagogue which they had built for the place of worship. And now I, Moroni,
      speak unto you, my beloved brethren; and it is by the grace of God, the Father, and our Lord
      Jesus Christ, and his holy will, because of the gift of his calling unto me, that I am
      permitted to speak unto you at this time; wherefore I would speak unto you that are of the
      church, that are the peaceable followers of Christ. and have obtained a sufficient hope, by
      which ye can enter into the rest of the Lord, from this time hence forth, until ye shall rest
      with him in Heaven. And now my brethren, I judge these things of you because of your peaceable
      walk with the children of men: for I remember the word of God, which saith, By their works ye
      shall know them: for if their works be good, then they are good also. For behold, God hath
      said, A man being evil, cannot do that which is good: for if he offereth a gift, or prayeth
      unto God, except he shall do it with real intent, it profiteth him nothing. For behold, it is
      not counted unto him for righteousness. For behold, if a man being evil, giveth a gift, he
      doeth it grudgingly; wherefore it is counted unto him the same as if he had retained the gift;
      wherefore he is counted evil before God. And likewise also is it counted evil unto a man, if
      he shall pray, and not with real intent of heart; yea, and it profiteth him nothing: for God
      receiveth none such; wherefore, a man being evil, cannot do that which is good; neither will
      he give a good gift. For behold, a bitter fountain cannot bring forth good water; wherefore a
      man being the servant of the Devil, cannot follow Christ; and if he follow Christ, he cannot
      be a servant of the Devil. Wherefore, all things which are good, cometh of God; and that which
      is evil, cometh of the Devil: for the Devil is an enemy unto God, and fighteth against him
      continually, and inviteth and enticeth to sin, and to do that which is evil continually. But
      behold, that which is of God, inviteth and enticeth to do good continually; wherefore, every
      thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to love God, and to serve him, is inspired
      of God. Wherefore take heed, my beloved brethren, that ye do not judge that which is evil to
      be of God, or that which is good and of God, to be of the Devil. For behold, my brethren, it
      is given unto you to judge is as plain, that ye may know with a perfect knowledge, as daylight
      is from the dark night. --For behold, the spirit of Christ is given to every man, that they
      may know good from evil; wherefore I shew unto you the way to judge: for every thing which
      inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift
      of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge, it is of God; but whatsoever thing
      persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye
      may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the Devil, for after this manner doth the Devil
      work: for he persuadeth no man to do good, no not one; neither doth his angels; neither doth
      they which subject themselves unto him. And now my brethren, seeing that ye know the light by
      which ye may judge, which is the light of Christ, see that ye do not judge wrongfully: for
      with that same judgment which ye judge, ye shall also be judged. Wherefore I beseech of you,
      brethren, that ye should preach diligently in the light of Christ, that ye may know good from
      evil; and if ye will lay hold upon every good thing and condemn it not, ye certainly will be a
      child of Christ. And now, my brethren, how is it possible that ye can lay hold upon every good
      thing? And now I come to that faith, of which I said I would speak; and I will tell you the
      way whereby ye may lay hold on every good thing. For behold, God knowing all things, being
      from everlasting to everlasting, behold, he sent angels to minister unto the children of men,
      to make manifest concerning the coming of Christ; and in Christ there should come every good
      thing. And God also declared unto prophets, by his own mouth, that Christ should come. And
      behold, there were diverse ways that he did manifest things unto the children of men, which
      were good; and all things which are good, cometh of Christ, otherwise men were fallen, and
      there could no good things come unto them. Wherefore, by the ministering of angels, and by
      every word which proceedeth forth out of the mouth of God, men began to exercise faith in
      Christ; and thus by faith, they did lay hold upon every good thing: and thus it were until the
      coming of Christ. And after that he came, men also were saved by faith in his name; and by
      faith, they become the sons of God. And as suredly as Christ liveth, he spake these words unto
      our fathers, saying, Whatsoever thing ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is good, in
      faith believing that ye shall receive, behold, it shall be done unto you. Wherefore, my
      beloved brethren, hath miracles ceased, because that Christ hath ascended into heaven, and
      hath set down on the right hand of God, to claim the Father his rights of mercy which he hath
      upon the children of men: for he hath answered the ends of the law, and he claimeth all those
      that hath faith in him; and they that have faith in him, will cleave unto every good thing;
      wherefore he advocateth the cause of the children of men; and he dwelleth eternally in the
      heavens. And because that he hath done this, my beloved brethren, hath miracles ceased? Behold
      I say unto you, Nay; neither hath angels ceased to minister unto the children of men. For
      behold, they are subject unto him, to minister according to the word of his command, shewing
      themselves unto them of strong faith and a firm mind, in every form of godliness. And the
      office of their ministry is, to call men unto repentance, and to fulfil and do the work of the
      covenants of the Father which he hath made unto the children of men, to prepare the way among
      the children of men, by declaring the word of Christ unto the chosen vessel of the Lord, that
      they may bear testimony of him; and by so doing, the Lord God prepareth the way that the
      residue of men may have faith in Christ, that the Holy Ghost may have place in their hearts,
      according to the power thereof: and after this manner bringeth to pass the Father the
      covenants which he hath made unto the children of men. And Christ hath said, if ye will have
      faith in me, ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me. And he hath said,
      Repent all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, and have faith
      in me, that ye may be saved. And now my beloved brethren, if this be the case that these
      things are true which I have spoken unto you, and God will shew unto you with power and great
      glory at the last day, that they are true; and if they are true, hath the day of miracles
      ceased? or hath angels ceased to appear unto the children of men? or hath he withheld the
      power of the Holy Ghost from them? or will he, so long as time shall last, or the earth shall
      stand, or there shall be one man upon the face thereof to be saved? Behold I say unto you Nay,
      for it is by faith that miracles are wrought; and it is by faith that angels appear and
      minister unto men; wherefore if these things have ceased, wo be unto the children of men, for
      it is because of unbelief, and all is vain: for no man can be saved, according to the words of
      Christ, save they shall have faith in his name; wherefore, if these things have ceased, than
      has faith ceased also; an awful is the state of man: for they are as though there had been no
      redemption made. But behold, my beloved brethren, I judge better things of you, for I judge
      that ye have faith in Christ, because of your meekness: for if ye have not both faith in him,
      then ye are not fit to be numbered among the people of his church. And again my beloved
      brethren, I would speak unto you concerning hope. How is it that ye can attain unto faith,
      save ye shall have hope? And what is it that ye shall hope for? Behold I say unto you, That ye
      shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be
      raised unto life eternal; and this because of your faith in him according to the promise;
      wherefore, if a man have faith, he must needs have hope: for without faith there cannot be any
      hope. And again: Behold I say unto you, That he cannot have faith and hope, save he shall be
      meek, and lowly of heart: if so, his faith and hope is vain, for none is acceptable before
      God, save the meek and lowly of heart; and if a man be meek and lowly in heart, and confesses
      by the power of the Holy Ghost, that Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have charity: for if
      he have not charity, he is nothing; wherefore he must needs have charity. And charity
      suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is
      not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not into iniquity, but rejoiceth in the
      truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things;
      wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never
      faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must
      fail; but charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found
      possessed of it, at the last day it shall be well with them. Wherefore, my beloved brethren,
      pray unto the Father with all energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love which he
      hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son Jesus Christ, that ye may become the
      sons of God, that when he shall appear, we shall be like him: for we shall see him as he is,
      that we may have this hope, that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen. </text>

    <text> And epistle of my father Moron, written to me, Moroni; and it was written unto me soon
      after my calling to the ministry. And on this wise did he write unto me, saying: My beloved
      son Moroni, I rejoice exceedingly that your Lord Jesus Christ hath been mindful of you, and
      hath called you to his ministry, and to his holy work. I am mindful of you always in my
      prayers, continually praying unto God the Father, in the name of his holy child, Jesus, that
      he, through his infinite goodness and grace, will keep you through the endurance of faith on
      his name to the end. And now my son, I speak unto you concerning that which grieveth me
      exceedingly: for it grieveth me that there should disputations rise among you. For if I have
      learned the truth, there has been disputations among you concerning the baptism of your little
      children. And now my son, I desire that ye should labor diligently, that this gross error
      should be removed from among you: for, for this intent I have written this epistle. For
      immediately after I had learned these things of you, I inquired of the Lord concerning this
      matter. And the word of the Lord came to me by the power of the Holy Ghost, saying, Listen to
      the words of Christ, your Redeemer, your Lord and your God. Behold, I came into the world not
      to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance; the whole need no physician, but they that
      are sick; wherefore little children are whole, for they are not capable of committing sin;
      wherefore the curse of Adam is taken from them in me, that it hath not power over them: and
      the law of circumcision is done away in me. And after this manner did the Holy Ghost manifest
      the word of God unto me; wherefore my beloved son, I know that it is solemn mockery before
      God, that ye should baptize little children. Behold, I say unto you, that this thing shall ye
      teach, repentance and baptism unto they which are accountable and capable of committing sin;
      yea, teach parents that they must repent and be baptized, and humble themselves as their
      little children, and they shall be saved with their little children; and their little children
      need no repentance, neither baptism. Behold, baptism is unto repentance to the fulfilling the
      commandments unto the remission of sins. But little children are alive in Christ, even from
      the foundation of the world; if not so, God is a partial God, and also a changeable God, and a
      respector to persons: for how many little children have died without baptism. Wherefore, if
      little children could not be saved without baptism, they must have gone to an endless hell.
      Behold I say unto you, That he that supposeth that little children needeth baptism, is in the
      gall of bitterness, and in the bonds iniquity: for he hath neither faith, hope, nor charity;
      wherefore, should he be cut off while in the thought, he must go down to hell. For awful is
      the wickedness to suppose that God saveth one child because of baptism, and the other must
      perish because he hath no baptism. Wo be unto him that shall pervert the ways of the Lord
      after this manner, for they shall perish, except they repent. Behold, I speak with boldness,
      having authority from God; and I fear not what man can do: for perfect love casteth out all
      fear; and I am filled with charity, which is everlasting love; wherefore all children are
      alike unto me; wherefore I love little children with a perfect love; and they are all alike,
      and partakers of salvation. For I know that God is not a partial God, neither a changeable
      being; but he is unchangeable from all eternity to all eternity. Little children cannot
      repent; wherefore it is awful wickedness to deny the pure mercies of God unto them, for they
      are all alive in him because of his mercy. And he that saith that little children needeth
      baptism, denieth the mercies of Christ, and setteth at nought the atonement of him and the
      power of his redemption. Wo unto such, for they are in danger of death, hell, and an endless
      torment. I speak it boldly, God hath commanded me. Listen unto them and give heed, or they
      stand against you at the judgment seat of Christ. For behold that all little children are
      alive in Christ, and also all they that are without the law. For the power of redemption
      cometh on all they that have no law; wherefore, he that is not condemned, or he that is under
      no condemnation, cannot repent; and unto such baptism availeth nothing. But it is a mockery
      before God denying the mercies of Christ, and the power of his holy spirit, and putting trust
      in dead works. Behold, my son, this thing had not ought to be: for repentance is unto them
      that are under condemnation, and under the curse of a broken law. And the first fruits of
      repentance is baptism; and baptism cometh by faith, unto the fulfilling the commandments; and
      the fulfilling the commandments bringeth remission of sins; and the remission of sins bringeth
      mekness, and lowliness of heart; and because of meekness, and lowliness of heart; cometh the
      visitation of the Holy Ghost, which comforter filleth with hope and perfect love, which love
      endureth by diligence unto prayer, until the end shall come when all the saints shall dwell
      with God. Behold, my son, I will write unto you again, if I go not out soon against the
      Lamanites. Behold, the pride of this nation, or the people of the Nephites, hath proved their
      destruction, except they should repent. Pray for them, my son, that repentance may come unto
      them. But behold, I fear lest the spirit hath ceased striving with them; and in this part of
      the land they are also seeking to put down all power and authority, which cometh from God; and
      they are denying the Holy Ghost. And after rejecting so great a knowledge, my son, they must
      perish soon, until the fulfilling of the prophecies which was spoken by the prophets, as well
      as the words of our Saviour himself. Farewell, my son, until I write unto you, or shall meet
      you again. Amen. </text>

    <text> My beloved son, I write unto you again, that ye may know that I am yet alive; but I write
      somewhat that which is grievous. For behold, I have had a sore battle with the Lamanites, in
      the which we did conquer; and Archeantus has fallen by the sword, and also Luram and Emron;
      yea, and we have lost a great number of our choice men. And now behold, my son, I fear lest
      the Lamanites shall destroy this people, for they do not repent, and Satan stireth them up
      continually to anger one with another. Behold, I am laboring with them continually; and when I
      speak the word of God with sharpness, they tremble and anger against me; and when I use no
      sharpness, they harden their hearts against it; wherefore I fear lest the spirit of the Lord
      hath ceased striving with them. For so exceedingly do they anger, that it seemeth me that they
      have no fear of death; and they have lost their love, one towards another; and they thirst
      after blood and revenge continually. And now my beloved son, notwithstanding their hardness,
      let us labor diligently: for if we should cease to labor, we should be brought under
      condemnation: for we have a labor to perform whilst in this tabernacle of clay, that we may
      conquer the enemy of all righteousness, and rest our souls in the kingdom of God. And now I
      write somewhat concerning the sufferings of this people. For according to the knowledge which
      I have received from Amoron, behold the Lamanites have many prisoners, which they took from
      the tower of Sherrizah; and there were men, women, and children. And the husbands and fathers
      of those women and children they have slain; and they feed the women upon the flesh of their
      husbands, and the children upon the flesh of their fathers; and no water, save a little do
      they give unto them. And notwithstanding this great abomination of the Lamanites, it doth not
      exceed that of our people in Moriantum. For behold, many of the daughters of the Lamanites
      have they taken prisoners; and after depriving them of that which was most dear and precious
      above all things, which is chastity and virtue; and after that they had done this thing, they
      did murder them in a most cruel manner, torturing their bodies even unto death; and after that
      they have done this, they devour their flesh like unto wild beasts, because of the hardness of
      their hearts; and they do it for a token of bravery. O my beloved son, how can a people like
      this, that are without civilization; (and only a few years have passed away, and they were a
      civil and a delightsome people;) but O my son, how can a people like this, whose delight is in
      so much abomination, how can we expect that God will stay his hand in judgment against us?
      Behold, my heart cries wo unto this people. Come out in judgment, O God, and hide their sins,
      and wickedness, and abominations from before thy face. And again, my son, there are many
      widows and their daughters, which remain in Sherrizah; and that part of the provisions which
      the Lamanites did not carry away, behold, the army of Zenephi has carried away, and left them
      to wander whithersoever they can for food; and many old women do faint by the way and die. And
      the army which is with me, is weak; and the armies of the Lamanites are betwixt Sherrizah and
      me; and as many as have fled to the army of Aaron, have fallen victims of their awful
      brutality. O the depravity of my people! they are without order and without mercy. Behold, I
      am but a man, and I have but the strength of a man, and I cannot any longer enforce my
      commands; and they have become strong in their perversion; and they are alike brutal, sparing
      none, neither old or young; and they delight in every thing save that which is good; and the
      sufferings of our women and our children upon all the face of this land, doth exceed every
      thing; yea, tongue cannot tell, neither can it be written, And now my son, I dwell no longer
      upon this horrible scene. Behold, thou knowest the wickedness of this people; thou knowest
      that they are without principle and past feeling; and their wickedness doth exceed that of the
      Lamanites. Behold, my son, I cannot recommend thee unto God, lest he should smite me. But
      beold, my son, I recommend thee unto God, and I trust in Christ that thou wilt be saved; and I
      pray unto God that he would spare thy life, to witness the return of his people unto him, or
      their utter destruction: for I know that they must perish, except they repent and return unto
      him; and if they perish, it will be like unto the Jaredites, because of the wilfulness of
      their hearts, seeking for blood and revenge. And if it so be that they perish, we know that
      many of our brethren are dissented over unto the Lamanites, and many more will also dissent
      over unto them; wherefore, write somewhat a few things, if thou art spared; and I shall perish
      and not see thee; but I trust that I may see thee soon: for I have sacred records that I would
      deliver up unto thee. My son, be faithful in Christ; and may not the things which I have
      written, grieve thee to weigh thee down unto death, but may Christ lift thee up, and may his
      sufferings and death, and the shewing his body unto our fathers, and his mercy and long
      suffering, and the hope of his glory and of eternal life, rest in your mind forever. And may
      the grace of God, the Father, whose throne is high in the heavens, and our Lord Jesus Christ,
      who sitteth on the right hand of his power, until all things shall become subject unto him,
      be, and abide with you forever. Amen. </text>

    <text> Now I, Moroni, write somewhat as seemeth me good; and I write unto my brethren, the
      Lamanites; and I would that they should know that more than four hundred and twenty years has
      passed away, since the sign was given of the coming of Christ. And I seal up these records
      after that I have spoken a few words by way of exhortation unto you. Behold, I would exhort
      you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them,
      that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the
      creation of Adam, even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it
      in your hearts. And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask
      God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall
      ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, and he will manifest the
      truth in you, by the power of the Holy Ghost; and by the power of the Holy Ghost, ye may know
      the truth of all things. And whatsoever thing is good, is just and true; wherefore, nothing
      that is good denieth the Christ, but acknowledgeth that he is. And ye may know that he is, by
      the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore I would exhort you, that ye deny not the power of God:
      for he worketh by power according to the faith of the children of men, the same to-day, and
      to-morrow, and forever. And again I exhort you, my brethren, that ye deny not the gifts of
      God, for they are many; and they come from the same God. And there are different ways that
      these gifts are administered; but it is the same God which worketh all in all: and they are
      given by the manifestations of the spirit of God unto men, to profit them. For behold, to one
      is given by the spirit of God, that he may teach the word of wisdom; and to another, that he
      may teach the word of knowledge by the same spirit; and to another, exceeding great faith; and
      to another, the gifts of healing by the same spirit. And again, to another, that he may work
      mighty miracles; and again, to another, that he may prophesy concerning all things; and again,
      to another, the beholding of angels and ministering spirits; and again, to another, all kinds
      of tongues; and again, to another, the interpretation of languages and of diverse kinds of
      tongues. And all these gifts comes by the spirit of Christ; and they come unto every man
      severally, according as he will. And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye remember
      that every good gift cometh of Christ. And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye
      remember that he is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever, and that all these gifts which I
      have spoken, which are spiritual, never will be done away, even as long as the world shall
      stand, only according to the unbelief of the children of men. Wherefore, there must be faith;
      and if there must be faith, there must also be hope; and if there must be hope, there must
      also be charity; and except ye have charity ye can in no wise be saved in the kingdom of God;
      neither can ye be saved in the kingdom of God, if ye have not faith; neither can ye, if ye
      have no hope; and if ye have no hope, ye must needs be in despair; and despair cometh because
      of iniquity. And Christ truly said unto our fathers, If ye have faith, ye can do all things
      which is expedient unto me. And now I speak unto all the ends of the earth, that if the day
      cometh that the power and gifts of God shall be done away among you, it shall be because of
      unbelief. And wo be unto the children of men, if this be the case: for there shall be none
      that doeth good among you, no not one. For if there be one among you that doeth good, he shall
      work by the power and gifts of God. And wo unto them which shall do these things away and die,
      for they die in their sins, and they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God; and I speak it
      according to the words of Christ, and I lie not. And I exhort you to remember these things:
      for the time speedily cometh that ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar
      of God: and the Lord God will say unto you, Did I not declare my words unto you, which was
      written by this man, like as one crying from the dead? yea,, even as one speaking out of the
      dust, I declare these things unto the fulfilling of the prophecies. And behold, they shall
      proceed forth out of the mouth of the everlasting God; and his word shall hiss forth from
      generation to generation. And God shall shew unto you, that that which I have written, is
      true. And again I would exhort you, that ye would come unto Christ, and lay hold upon every
      good gift, and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing. --And awake, and arise from the
      dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put on thy beautiful garments, O daughter of Zion, and strengthen
      thy stakes, and enlarge thy borders forever, that thou mayest no more be confounded, that the
      covenants of the Eternal Father, which he hath made unto thee, O house of Israel, may be
      fulfilled. Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all
      ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your
      might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be
      perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in no wise deny
      the power of God. And again, if ye, by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not
      his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the
      blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father, unto the remission of your sins, that
      ye become holy without spot. And now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon go to rest in the
      paradise of God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite, and I am brought forth
      triumphant through the air, to meet you before the pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the
      Eternal Judge of both quick and dead. Amen. </text>
